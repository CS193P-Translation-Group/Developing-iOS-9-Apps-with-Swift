00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,469
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:08,040
>> Stanford University. >> Okay, well, this is

3
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:13,212
lecture six of Stanford SC193 P Spring of 2016. And today we

4
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:18,283
are gonna dive in more into this topic of multiple MVCs.

5
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,652
If you remember, last lecture I talked a little about

6
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:24,089
multiple MVCs and how we can combine them with tab bars,

7
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,492
split view controllers and navigation controllers. And

8
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:28,961
we showed a little bit how to wire them up. Well, today, I'm

9
00:00:28,963 --> 00:00:32,464
gonna talk a little about how we transition between them,

10
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,334
right? It's one thing to wire them up in our storyboard, but

11
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:38,237
as the user navigates our user interface, clicks on buttons

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,408
and stuff, we want to navigate between these MVCs, okay?

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,676
And then, time permitting at the end, I'm gonna talk

14
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,979
a little bit more about this view controller lifecycle, the

15
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:50,616
thing that I always delete. Okay? Those two methods.

16
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,085
There's a few more methods in the view controller lifecycle

17
00:00:53,087 --> 00:00:55,854
that I'm gonna talk about, and again, time permitting,

18
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:00,192
I'll do a quick little demo at the end. All right.

19
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:03,529
So, segues. Okay, we've wired up these controllers of

20
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:07,032
controllers like tab bar split fuse navigation controllers,

21
00:01:07,034 --> 00:01:09,268
and we've got all of our nice MVCs, and

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,636
now we want to transition between them.

23
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,571
We call those transitions segues, right?

24
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,641
The word segue in English means a transition. And

25
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,876
there's really four major kinds of segues.

26
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,213
I'm gonna talk about some more rare segues towards the end of

27
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,982
the quarter, but the main segues that you're gonna wire

28
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:27,519
up in a story board, one is called a show segue.

29
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,889
So, remember the navigation controller that's the stack of

30
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:34,093
cards, right? The settings app I showed you where you're

31
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,862
putting more stacks on the card. Well, transitioning to

32
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:40,632
put a new card on the stack, okay, is done using a show,

33
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:44,336
what we call a show sequeway cuz it shows another MVP or

34
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:48,006
MVC. I'm thinking about Steph Curry, I guess, okay?

35
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:53,145
MVC. And then, show detail is if you have a split view,

36
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,380
okay, and something happens in the master and

37
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:59,351
you want to show an MVC, a different MVC in the detail,

38
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:04,423
okay? Show detail, that's the detail of a split view.

39
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:07,259
Show detail also works in a navigation controller,

40
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:09,728
okay? So, if you do show detail, it's this really

41
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,564
the same as show in a navigation controller, unless

42
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:17,503
that navigation controller is inside of a split view, okay?

43
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,004
Show and show detail would be the same. But

44
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,440
if a navigation controller's inside a split view,

45
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,710
then show means show it in the Navigation Controller, and

46
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:26,979
Show Detail means show it in the Split View Controller,

47
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:30,382
right? Show the detail. Then there's Modal and Popover,

48
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,352
I'm not gonna talk about those today. Modal is basically

49
00:02:33,354 --> 00:02:37,289
segue into takeover the entire screen with another MVC, okay?

50
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,392
And a popover is almost exactly the same except for

51
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,326
instead of taking over the entire screen,

52
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:44,763
it still takes over the entire screen in terms of input, but

53
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,832
it draws it in a little popover window and

54
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,300
everything else is kind of grayed out and

55
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,703
you can click on the grayed out to dismiss the popover.

56
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,940
Okay? So those are the major kinds of segue that you wire

57
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:55,607
up in your story boards.

58
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,943
So, we're gonna talk about navigation controllers,

59
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:59,444
split view controllers, tab bar today.

60
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,446
So, for navigation and split view controllers,

61
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,781
we're talking about show and show detail, okay?

62
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,785
So, we're gonna talk about today. All right. It's very

63
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,555
important to understand that segue virtually

64
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:13,892
always create a new MVC. Okay? If you segue to an MVC,

65
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:17,596
it's going to create it. You rarely, extremely rare,

66
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,066
there's only one kind of segue where you're gonna segue to

67
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:24,736
an MVC that already exists. Okay? So, segues create new

68
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,906
MVCs, okay? Super important to understand. That's even true

69
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,410
in a split view. If you do a show detailed segue,

70
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,980
it replaces the MVC that's in the detail side.

71
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:37,816
That's why we sometimes call a show detail a replace segue,

72
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:42,254
okay? That's kind of its old name. All right? So, how do we

73
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,357
make these segues happen, okay? Just like we always do,

74
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,959
we control drag, okay? Just like we

75
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,395
control drag to wire up our MVCs to our split view

76
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,931
control, navigation control, we're also gonna control drag

77
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,701
to determine how they segue up to each other, okay? How they

78
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:59,204
transition. It's also possible to make segues happen in code.

79
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,974
There's a method you call that says do this segue,

80
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:05,177
perform segue, it's called, okay? So

81
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,480
here is something wired up as of our last lecture, here.

82
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,748
I've got a split view controller,

83
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,653
and the detail is this little graphing thing at the bottom.

84
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,189
And the master is a navigation controller with

85
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,958
your little calculator view controller right there, okay?

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,060
That calculator view controller up there,

87
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:25,163
looking at this side today, that calculator up there might

88
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:27,966
be exactly the same MVC as the one you're building in your

89
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:32,437
homework, okay? All right? So, if we want to add a button to

90
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,707
the calculator that caused this graph to show,

91
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,377
maybe graph what's in your calculator. Wouldn't that be

92
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:42,881
cool? Then we would Ctrl-drag from that little button.

93
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,484
Can hardly see that button, but it's there. Ctrl-drag to

94
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,987
the MVC we wanna segue to. Okay? So, that's how it works.

95
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,524
You would just Ctrl-drag to. Now, when you Ctrl-drag to,

96
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:55,394
it's gonna put up a little black window here,

97
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,897
which I'll zoom in on, which is going to ask you what kind

98
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:02,000
of segue do you want. Do you want a show? A show detail?

99
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,203
A modal? Or a popover? Okay? So if you want this to appear

100
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:08,707
as the detail in a split view, you're gonna pick Show Detail.

101
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,409
Otherwise, it's just in a navigation controller,

102
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:14,012
you're gonna pick Show, okay? Again, we'll talk about

103
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,348
the other two later in the quarter. All right?

104
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,151
So, you've got that wired up. As soon as you do that,

105
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:20,852
you've get this little guy appearing here,

106
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:23,522
this line with a little thing in the middle here.

107
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25,991
This is the segue. Okay? And this segue,

108
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:29,261
just like a button or anything else, is inspectable. So

109
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,264
if you go over here to the inspector and inspect it,

110
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:34,666
it's going to let you set some things about the segue.

111
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,537
The most important thing is its identifier, okay?

112
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:41,340
Every segue needs an identifier, because in your

113
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,975
code, you're gonna have to refer to that segue,

114
00:05:43,977 --> 00:05:46,411
and you do it by name. By this identifier.

115
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,947
That's how you're gonna refer to this in your code.

116
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,118
So it's critical that you give your segues names, okay?

117
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,353
This identifier thing. And

118
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:59,157
we'll see that in the demo. And the name of

119
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:03,595
the identifier should probably describe what the segue does.

120
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:07,366
It's usually a verb, like a verb phrase like show graph,

121
00:06:07,368 --> 00:06:09,835
do something. Cuz that's what segues do, they do something.

122
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:15,240
So it's usually some kind of verb phrase. Okay. So, what,

123
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:20,879
so, where in our code are we gonna use that identifier for

124
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:21,046
the segue?

125
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,882
It's really two places. One place that we don't use too

126
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:27,185
much is when we want to make that segue happen from code.

127
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:30,655
And we can do that with this method in UI view controller,

128
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,356
okay? You have your controller.

129
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,126
You all know what that is, okay? It's called perform

130
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:37,095
segue with identifier. You give it the identifier, and

131
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,565
then you can pass any object you want as the sender, okay?

132
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,969
The sender is the object that is causing the segue to

133
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,506
happen. Often that's a button, okay? But when you're doing it

134
00:06:47,508 --> 00:06:50,509
from code, you can send any object really that you want.

135
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,645
Okay? And you'll see why we need that in a moment. Okay?

136
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:55,514
So that's one reason you need the identifier.

137
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:58,850
But a much more important reason is because when a segue

138
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:01,620
happens, the MVC your segueing to,

139
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:05,390
usually needs to be prepared to come on screen. Okay?

140
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,391
It needs some information.

141
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,628
Maybe it needs it's model to be set. That's a common thing.

142
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,398
Maybe it needs some of it's drawing attributes to be set,

143
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,804
okay? So that is happening in this preparation.

144
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:19,771
So, this is so important.

145
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,808
I'm gonna talk about the preparation in detail. Now,

146
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,278
the preparation happens with a method that is sent to

147
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,916
the view controller that is causing this segue to happen.

148
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:31,750
Not the view controller on

149
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,385
the other end that's being created, but

150
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,120
the one that is causing it to happen, okay?

151
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:38,190
That view controller is gonna be sent this message,

152
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:41,993
prepare for segue. Okay? And it's job in this method is

153
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,564
to prepare the MVC that's being created by the segue to

154
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:49,000
do what it wants to do. Now, it's really important to

155
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:52,637
understand with this multi-MVC world, that it's object

156
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,841
oriented in that each MVC kind of has it's own world.

157
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:59,444
Okay, they don't really wanna be talking back to each other.

158
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,647
And the MVC on the ender end of a segue is really part

159
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,218
of the view of the MVC that's causing the segue. Remember

160
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,554
those graphics that I told you? So we really can't talk

161
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:12,357
back to the one causing the segue. We would have to use

162
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,926
some kind of blind structured communication because the view

163
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,829
is not really allowed to talk to its controller, except for

164
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,231
in these structured ways, right?

165
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,398
The controller can talk to the view,

166
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,134
no problem. And he's going to here. This is going to be

167
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:26,204
the controller talking to its view by preparing

168
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:26,471
that MVC. But

169
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,641
you really wanna think of MVCs as living in their own world,

170
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,210
self-contained, they have some public API,

171
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,714
you set things in their public API, and they do what they do,

172
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,984
okay? It's very tempting when you're writing code,

173
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,052
especially maybe a lot of the code that you've written so

174
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,555
far in classes, to think, well, I can just put a method

175
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,924
here and a method there, and they can all call each other,

176
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,426
and it's all fine. But it's not, you need to start

177
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:51,630
thinking in terms of programming interfaces, okay,

178
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:55,200
encapsulation, true object oriented programming here.

179
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,403
Okay, I made you think about that a little bit in your

180
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:58,436
calculator brain and the calculator view controller,

181
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:01,640
assignment with

182
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:03,642
right? The calculator brain has a public API,

183
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,677
it's very clear what the public methods are,

184
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,847
those are the only methods a controller can use, okay?

185
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:09,915
Hopefully you didn't write your assignment,

186
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,584
where they're each calling, private messaging each other,

187
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,987
or things like that, okay? There's gotta be well-defined,

188
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,956
what those objects encapsulate, okay.

189
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,491
That's object oriented programming. So

190
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:23,028
same thing here, but at the whole MVC level, right?

191
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,331
We want the MVCs to be well-defined in what they do.

192
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:30,101
All right, so let's talk about prepareForSegue here and,

193
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:30,235
how you make it work, what all the parts of it are, okay? So

194
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,572
what it does,

195
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,140
first of all, you have the arguments here for

196
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:38,443
prepareForSegue. The first argument is the segue. So

197
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:42,113
this is a instance of a class called UIStoryboardSegue.

198
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,717
And it contains interesting information about the segue,

199
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,152
most notably the identifier.

200
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:51,356
Okay, that identifier we typed in the inspector, and also,

201
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,993
the controller of the MVC that you're segueing to.

202
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:59,164
It just created it, and you can, cuz remember,

203
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,866
segue is always created an MVC, so it just created

204
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:03,835
that thing, and you can get a pointer to it

205
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:07,072
from this segue argument right here, one of the properties on

206
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:10,775
UIStoryboardSegue is the destination view controller.

207
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,911
Okay, this other argument here, sender,

208
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:16,915
it's the same sender as was in perform segue with identifier.

209
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:20,452
This is just who caused this segue to happen. Usually,

210
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:23,622
it's a button, okay. But it could be any object if you,

211
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,658
if it started in code with perform segue with identifier,

212
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,295
okay? So we'll, we'll see this in the demo sometimes why you

213
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:35,300
would wanna know who this is, okay? All right, so

214
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,234
here's the identifier,

215
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:39,904
I'm getting it with the, var here called identifier,

216
00:10:39,906 --> 00:10:42,807
right, the property off of the segue thing.

217
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,710
I'm checking here to make sure it's not nil. Because someone

218
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,679
might have created a segue in the storyboard, and

219
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,314
they forgot to set the identifier or

220
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,282
they didn't set the identifier. So

221
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:51,416
it could be nil, so

222
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,119
I'm checking to make sure it's not nil here. And then

223
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,088
I'm switching on it, okay? So I'm gonna switch on it.

224
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,624
And in this case, I'm gonna look for Show Graph,

225
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,627
which is in my previous slide, that's what I called,

226
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:05,363
that's what the identifier for that thing was.

227
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:09,200
And when I see that this is a Show Graph segue, then

228
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:13,705
I'm going to try and prepare the destination of the segue,

229
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:17,609
assuming that it is some sort of graph controller, right,

230
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,176
some code controller,

231
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:20,245
controller of an MVC that shows the graph. So

232
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,080
I'm gonna have to prepare it, I'm gonna have to prepare it,

233
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:25,216
okay. So the first thing that I'm gonna do is I'm gonna look

234
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,420
at the destination view controller of the segue, where

235
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:32,457
we're segueing to, okay. And I'm gonna see if it's a graph

236
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,693
controller. And it better be, because that's the only

237
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:38,730
way I know how to prepare for a segue called Show Graph. So

238
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:42,367
this thing better be, but I am doing if let with as to,

239
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:46,604
to see if it is, because destination view controller,

240
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:50,041
its type is just UIViewController, okay. So

241
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,311
I need to cast it with as just like I cast any

242
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:54,546
object sometimes with as.

243
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,915
Here I'm gonna cast this view controller, if I can,

244
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,751
to be a specific kind of controller that I'm expecting

245
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:02,754
this segue to be segueing to. Okay, so in this case,

246
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:05,824
some sort of graph controller of some sort. All right,

247
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:09,961
now once I've done that, now VC right here is gonna be

248
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,498
of type graph controller. Okay, that's what if let

249
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,434
this as that does, right, inside this curly brace,

250
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:20,038
vc is gonna be of type graph controller. And so I can start

251
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,743
sending messages and setting properties, public ones only,

252
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:29,814
of this controller in order to prepare it to do its job. So

253
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,117
if it's a graph controller, I don't know,

254
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,919
it might wanna know the axes, the range of the axes.

255
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:38,289
Somehow it might wanna know what function it's graphing,

256
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,992
I don't know. Okay, but that is happening in here,

257
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,728
where I'm preparing this graph controller that just got

258
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:48,433
created cuz of a segue to do what it does. Okay, questions

259
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:53,238
about that? All right, so it's really important

260
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,840
to understand, and that's why it's in red here, I don't put

261
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:59,077
things in red very often. But it's in red that when you're

262
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,046
doing this prepare of that destination view controller,

263
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:07,218
it was only just created just now, okay, femtoseconds ago,

264
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,090
okay. So its outlets have not been set, okay. This happens

265
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:15,393
before its outlets are set. This is quite annoying, okay,

266
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,896
because usually when you wanna prepare a view controller,

267
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,899
you wanna set things up in its outlets, like a calculator

268
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,767
one, you'd want to set something in the display or

269
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:25,403
something like that. But you can't do that, okay,

270
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,171
unfortunately, you can't do that.

271
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,306
This is happening before your outlets are set, so

272
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,009
you have to just give it the data it wants, and you're just

273
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:33,545
gonna have to hold on to that data. And then after its

274
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:37,015
outlets are set, it can start parceling that out to its UI,

275
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:41,052
okay? You will, at least once this quarter, get a crash,

276
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:44,522
because you'll start preparing some view controller.

277
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:47,792
You'll start accessing its outlets, it goes out with your

278
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:50,361
still nil, and you're gonna get optional nil was

279
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:53,097
accessed, okay. I'm gonna do it in my demo just to show

280
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,300
you it happening because it can happen so much.

281
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:58,770
All right, okay, so that's preparing,

282
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:03,041
super important part of segues, okay, so preparing.

283
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:06,110
Now there's a method you can also implement in your view

284
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:09,113
controller in addition to prepareForSegue called,

285
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:11,416
shouldPerformSegueWithIdentif- ier, okay.

286
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:14,219
And that is basically gonna return a bool, whether or

287
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:18,423
not that segue should happen. So you can prevent it, for

288
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,891
example, let's say in your calculator,

289
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,527
let's say you had a button that did a graph, and

290
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,229
let's say it was a partial result, so

291
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,999
you couldn't really graph it. This might return false, okay?

292
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,703
And maybe you'll see that on your homework. All right, so

293
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,905
the demo I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take FaceIt,

294
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,407
that we have so far that draws that face, I'm gonna add

295
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,510
a second MVC, okay. And this MVC's gonna have some emotions

296
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,279
listened in it, and when you click on them,

297
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,415
it's gonna show a face that reflects that emotion, okay?

298
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,350
So I'm gonna have two MVCs, and

299
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:53,358
we're gonna hook them up. Okay,

300
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,161
so here we are back in FaceIt, exactly where we were.

301
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:00,531
I haven't, added anything or changed anything, right?

302
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,700
So we've got our face view controller right here,

303
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,703
it's got its model, which is a facial expression. And

304
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,506
then it's got its view, which is this face view thing right

305
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:12,977
here. We add some gestures, we update our UI when this thing

306
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,447
is first set, our update UI just takes the model,

307
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,651
all these things out of the model, okay? And

308
00:15:19,653 --> 00:15:21,653
it turns them into things in the view,

309
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:23,922
and and these are just the handlers for

310
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,256
these gestures. And that's it, so

311
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,760
that's all we have in our controller. And our story

312
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,796
board is really, really simple, it only has this one

313
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:35,433
view controller, okay, this face view controller. And

314
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,503
what I'm gonna do right off the bat is add another MVC.

315
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,572
So how do you add another MVC to your storyboard?

316
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:45,043
Well, you go over here to your object palette, and just like

317
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:48,579
from your object palette, you can do things like, adding

318
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:51,816
buttons and labels, you can also add entirely new MVCs.

319
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,485
And the way you do that is by grabbing this thing called

320
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:57,889
view controller at the top. In dragging it out into your

321
00:15:57,891 --> 00:16:00,224
storyboard, okay. You can put it right there.

322
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:03,628
You can move things around wherever you want. Okay, so

323
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,098
now I have two MVCs in here. One really interesting thing

324
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:12,704
to note is that an NVC always need to have a custom class.

325
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,472
Okay, if it doesn't have a custom class,

326
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,874
where are you going to put your outlets and actions and

327
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:20,311
all that stuff. So just like this view controller,

328
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,981
if you look at it's identity inspector, remember we changed

329
00:16:22,983 --> 00:16:25,650
it's identity and the identity inspector to be face

330
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,719
view controller, okay. So that makes it so

331
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:30,655
that this class is the controller for that thing, so

332
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:34,859
it has a model and outlets and things like that. Okay we need

333
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,128
to do the exact same thing with this view controller.

334
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,164
It needs to have a custom class. So the way you create

335
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,034
classes, you'll remember just like we did when we created

336
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:46,938
Face view for example. Is we do new file here. Okay so

337
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,174
I'm do new file. It's going to be iOS source, It's going to

338
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,543
be Coco Touch class because it's going to be a sub class

339
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:56,047
of UI view controller. Just like Face View controller was.

340
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,983
So I'm gonna double click here. Here, subclass of,

341
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:02,453
this is good, okay. Remember we did UI View before,

342
00:17:02,455 --> 00:17:05,523
now we want UI View controller as our class. We don't want

343
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:07,859
to call it view controller, that's a very generic name, so

344
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,862
I'm gonna call it Emotions View Controller because that's

345
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,563
what it shows. This view controller shows emotions,

346
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:16,134
okay. Put it in the same place we always put it,

347
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,536
right here, same same as all our other code.

348
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,373
And here we go. Here's our emotions view controller,

349
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,509
again I'm going to remove these few controller

350
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:28,513
life cycle methods for now. But

351
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,114
notice also when I created this,

352
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:34,819
I got this little method. What is this method? Prepare for

353
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:38,256
segue. Okay, segues are so important to have in multiple

354
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,825
view controllers. That when it gives you a blank one, it

355
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:43,161
always gives you prepare for segue commented out, but it

356
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,530
knows you're almost certainly gonna want to prepare for

357
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,865
segue. Okay, that's how important this is. And indeed

358
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:51,436
we are gonna have to implement this if we want clicking on

359
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,172
emotions to go to our other MVC and do things, okay?

360
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:57,008
But we're not going to do this right now. The next

361
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,677
thing we're going to do, and you'll forget this step, okay?

362
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,213
You will for sure forget this step multiple times.

363
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:05,983
Which is we have to remember to go here and set in

364
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:11,155
the identity inspector, the class of this thing to be that

365
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:13,958
emotion's view controller. A lot of times you will create

366
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,560
that emotion view control, you just dive right in,

367
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,929
you start programming, and you forget to do this, and then

368
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,931
you cannot connect any of your outlets, and you are like,

369
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,300
what is wrong with this thing? Okay, well this is why.

370
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,835
You forgot to type your identity, here,

371
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,537
okay? So, now I have two, you see? This one says emotions

372
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,040
view controller and this says face view controller, so

373
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,510
two NVCs. Notice this little arrow right here.

374
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:37,014
You see this arrow? This arrow tells the app when it runs,

375
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,884
start with this view controller. So

376
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,854
if I were to run right now it would show the face, but

377
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,556
if I wanted to show my new view controller first I can

378
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,560
just pick this arrow up and drop it on this one.

379
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:52,630
Okay, so let's go ahead and run actually to verify that.

380
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:58,536
We should get a nice blank screen. Okay?

381
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:02,540
Here it is. Nice blank screen, working perfectly. Now,

382
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:05,977
one thing to notice, also is, it, I got a warning here.

383
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,113
Look, see this warning? Scene is unreachable due to lack of

384
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,715
entry points. It's talking about this scene,

385
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:14,385
okay? By the way, we call these MVCs in the storyboard.

386
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,055
This is called a scene. Okay? A scene. So this scene

387
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:21,025
is unreachable, because this arrow doesn't point to it.

388
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:25,396
And nothing in here segues to it. So you can't get to it,

389
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,431
okay, which makes sense. So

390
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:30,434
it's good that it's warning us about that. All right let me

391
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:33,871
build the UI of this guy right here. Okay? As I said it's

392
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:37,642
just gonna have some emotions in here that you can click on.

393
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,211
Normally you probably wanna do this with the table view.

394
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,446
Okay a table and extensible list of them.

395
00:19:42,448 --> 00:19:45,016
But I can't I'm not teaching a table view until next week.

396
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:46,484
So we're gonna use buttons. All right?

397
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:52,156
So I'm just drag out four buttons here to be my

398
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:57,828
the four emotions that I am going to have here.

399
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,763
Sorry, put this in here.

400
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,499
And when I drag it out, it does not really matter where I

401
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,101
put it because I am going to stack view them. So

402
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:07,939
let us go ahead and make the font a little bigger here, 40

403
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:13,144
point. And so what buttons do we wanna have here? How about

404
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:17,915
an angry button and we'll have three other buttons.

405
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:24,922
How about happy and how about worried? Is that a,

406
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,991
an emotion, worried? I don't, I don't know.

407
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:30,995
It's good to make a face of it though. How about mischievous?

408
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:34,865
Mischievous, is that how you spell that?

409
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,667
Again I'm not sure that's an emotion, but

410
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:39,870
it makes a good face. Okay so here I have my things,

411
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:40,605
I'm going to stack view these.

412
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:45,176
Just going to select them all and go embed in stack view.

413
00:20:45,178 --> 00:20:46,844
I don't want them left aligned like this, so

414
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,947
I'm going to change their alignment to fill the space.

415
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,317
I'll do fill equally although they're all the same font so

416
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,019
they're all gonna be the same height anyway so

417
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:58,823
it doesn't really matter there. So,

418
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:02,660
I want these words to always be in the middle of my screen,

419
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,895
even if I'm rotated like if I'm in landscape or

420
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:07,565
portrait, I always want them in the middle. So I'm gonna

421
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,735
use the dash blue lines to put it right in the middle.

422
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:13,704
And now you're going to do the same trick we did before,

423
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:14,739
which was rest to suggested constraints and

424
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,475
it's going to use those blue lines

425
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:20,444
to suggest some constraints to constrain this stack for

426
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,180
you on here. And let's go look what it suggested,

427
00:21:23,182 --> 00:21:26,284
remember to do that we go over here to the size inspector.

428
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,320
We go down to where it says constraints, and sure enough,

429
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:32,023
align the center in the x-axis to superview and

430
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,158
align the center in the y-axis to superview. Perfect,

431
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:39,363
exactly what I want. So now if I run, it's gonna center this

432
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:43,567
horizontally and vertically. Okay, even if I'm in

433
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:48,406
landscape. Okay? So now, I've built this UI. Great,

434
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:52,943
it's exactly what I want. And I had now have two NVCs. Now,

435
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:56,347
I'm gonna show you all three ways of combining NVCs, tab

436
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,583
bars, split view controllers, and navigation controllers.

437
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,019
Let's start with tab bar controller, okay? How would I

438
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:05,289
put these two things one in its, each in its own tab?

439
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:10,161
Well, I'm gonna go down here, okay? To our object pallet.

440
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,730
And if you look, about six or seven down, there's this.

441
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:15,733
Tab bar controller, you see that? And if I drag this

442
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:19,937
out here, okay, it'll put this tab bar out here.

443
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,107
It unfortunately also brings some extra MVCs here,

444
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:26,944
these little blank MVCs that I don't want. So I'm just gonna

445
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:29,647
click on those and delete them. So get rid of that one.

446
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:33,084
And get rid of that one. So all I have now is my tab bar

447
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:37,088
controller. If you can read that, I'll zoom in a little.

448
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,658
Okay see tab bar controller and then I've got my two

449
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,994
MVC's here that I created. My emotions view controller and

450
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:47,598
my face view controller. Now I for sure want

451
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,868
the app to start with the tab bar controller, so I'm going

452
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,003
to move that arrow. This is another thing you'll forget.

453
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:56,140
You'll forget to move this arrow. Okay. And

454
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:59,243
now I just want this to be in one tab and this in the other.

455
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:02,012
I just do that with control drag. So control

456
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:06,150
drag to this one, I'm going to hook up this view controllers.

457
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:06,851
Remember the view controllers

458
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:10,354
property in a tab bar is just an array of all the tabs.

459
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,991
Okay, the MVCs is there in the tabs and do this one also,

460
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:17,528
that in the view controllers array, okay. You can even see

461
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,897
it's already starting to put the tabs on the bottom.

462
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,933
If you wanted to edit what's in these tabs, like the names,

463
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:26,137
you think, you double click down here something, but no,

464
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:30,708
because this is the Tab Bar Controller and these titles

465
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,246
and images are all set by the MVCs inside. Okay,

466
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,482
in an object oriented way, right. So, if you wanted to

467
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,484
set this you would actually go to each one of them.

468
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,621
And you can even double click right here and put in whatever

469
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:47,191
you want. You can also click here and inspect them, okay,

470
00:23:47,193 --> 00:23:50,594
if you go to the inspector, you can set images and also

471
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:55,332
a bunch of system ones. Okay, so that's how you set that.

472
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:59,403
So this is what our Storyboard looks like right now and

473
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:06,844
if we run this. We'll see that we get a tab bar.

474
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,313
See, it's got two tabs at the bottom here. And

475
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,616
if I click between them, I get my two MVCs.

476
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,187
Now this is completely inappropriate to what I'm

477
00:24:16,189 --> 00:24:19,690
building here because I would never want, if I clicked on

478
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:23,360
one of these, for it to switch over to this tab, okay?

479
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:27,498
That's because when you do a tab bar UI, listen closely,

480
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,935
the user owns which tab is showing, okay?

481
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:33,871
They get to choose by clicking on those tabs. You don't get

482
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,240
to choose by throwing them over to one, okay?

483
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:40,811
That is not appropriate for tab bar. Everyone got that? So

484
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:43,681
things in a tab bar UI tend to be independent things,

485
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:45,950
things that don't segue from one to another,

486
00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:48,786
you can't even make a segue from one tab to another, so no

487
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:52,823
such segue. So we don't want to do a tab bar controller

488
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,259
here, so I'm just going to delete my tab bar controller,

489
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,962
okay? Now one thing you'll notice when I deleted my tab

490
00:24:57,964 --> 00:25:02,333
bar controller is, where's my arrow? Okay, it's gone. So

491
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:05,102
now it's not going to, if I run, I'm actually going to get

492
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:08,506
an error in the console saying I don't know where to start

493
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,909
in my storyboard, basically. So how do you get that arrow

494
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,511
back? Just click the one you want

495
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,281
the arrow to be on, inspect it, and go right down here,

496
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,550
very top, is initial view controller,

497
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:22,786
if you turn that on, the arrow will come back there, okay?

498
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:25,990
And you can move it, okay, down to here if you want.

499
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:30,027
Okay? All right, so let's talk about split view controller.

500
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,230
We haven't even done anything with iPad at all in this class
目前为止，这门课还没有任何涉及 iPad 应用的内容

501
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,200
yet. So this is our first time doing it and we're gonna put
所以现在是我们第一次讨论关于

502
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:40,004
this in split view controller where this is the master and
有 master controller 和 detail controller 的

503
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:41,839
this is the detail, makes sense, right?
split view controller 明白了没？
504
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:42,706
Because we're clicking in the master,
我们点这个展示 master controller

505
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,110
this will be the detail that's shown from clicking on this.
点这个展示 detail controller

506
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:47,545
So how do we do a split view controller?
我们怎么处理一个 split view controller 呢？

507
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,514
Same way as tab bar. I'm gonna go down here, right below tab
给 tab bar 的一样，我在这里

508
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,884
bar is split view controller. I'm gonna drag that out,
Tab Bar Controller 下面就是这个 Split View Controller

509
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,987
I get a whole bunch of junk with it. We'll zoom out so
把这个拖出来，我就得到了一大堆垃圾(controller)

510
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:00,858
you can see it. Okay. See, I got all these extra things, so
缩小了你就看见了，我得到了好多额外的东西

511
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,526
I'm gonna, click on these extra things and
所以我要把这些额外的统统删掉

512
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:05,896
delete them, don't want any of them. Okay. So I just have
一个都不想留，所以我现在只有

513
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,832
the split view controller and my two guys here.
这个 split view controller 和 刚刚那两个 controller

514
00:26:08,834 --> 00:26:11,402
Of course I want the split view controller, again,
我想让这个 split view controller 变为最早展示出来

515
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:14,471
to be the start so I'm going to put the arrow there. And
所以我把箭头放在这里

516
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:18,676
then, in order to hook up master and detail, Ctrl+Drag.
然后，为了将 master、detail 与 split view controller 联系起来

517
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:24,181
Master, Ctrl+Drag, detail. Okay,
Ctrl+Drag 选择 Master，Ctrl+Drag 选择 detail

518
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,917
so that's how we set it up, couldn't be simpler. So let's
我们就是这么建立起他们的关系，再简单不过了

519
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,854
run, but let's run on iPad, so I'm gonna, on iPad 2 here,
现在在 iPad 上运行，我用 iPad 2 模拟器

520
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:34,425
we'll run and hopefully this will show up as a master and
运行起来，希望这个会作为 master 

521
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:42,566
this will be the detail. All right. So here's the iPad.
这个会作为 detail 展示出来，这是 iPad

522
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:45,469
Here's the detail. You notice that when it's in portrait
这是 detail controller，你可能注意到当在竖屏状态下

523
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,604
it fills the screen with the detail,
detail controller 充满了屏幕

524
00:26:46,606 --> 00:26:50,608
and you get the master by dragging out from the side.
通过拖动侧边，master controller 就展示出来了

525
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,744
See that? Okay? That's how you get the master. And
看到了吗？竖屏就通过这种方式看到 master controller

526
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:54,778
if you're in landscape,
如果横过来，变成横屏状态

527
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,782
then they're both onscreen at the same time. Now, if I click
master 和 detail 就在屏幕上同时展示出来

528
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:02,753
on these, I want this face to show me angry, show me happy,
如果我点 Angry，我希望这个脸变成生气的样子

529
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,455
show me worried, show me mischievous, okay?
变成高兴、变成担忧、变成淘气的样子

530
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:07,224
So how do I do that? This is where the segues come in.
这怎么做呢？这时我们就需要用到 segue 了

531
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:10,561
Okay? This is where we have to have this view controller
我们需要让这个 view controller 转场

532
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:12,396
segue to create a new one of these and
然后 create 一个detail controller

533
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:15,132
when it creates this, it's going to create it with
当 create 时，会 create 一个有确切表情值的 controller

534
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,769
the proper facial expression, okay? So it's going to prepare
所以，它会准备好表情值

535
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:22,172
it with a facial expression and show it. Okay? So
然后将这个确切的表情展示出来
536
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:26,276
let's do those segues. The way we do segues, also Ctrl+Drag.
我们来设置这些转场，同样是 Ctrl Drag 设置

537
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,847
So, let me zoom in here so you can see this. All right?
我放大点你就可以看到了

538
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:32,783
I'm gonna Ctrl+Drag from whichever of these buttons
我按住 segue 开始的 button，然后 Ctrl + Drag 

539
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,352
I want to segue from. I'm gonna segue from all four, so
我想从这4个button开始连 segue

540
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:38,222
I'm gonna have four segues. So like angry here I'm
所以我应该有4个segue，像从这里按住 angry button

541
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:42,493
just gonna Ctrl+Drag down to this MVC. And let go.
然后 Ctrl + Drag 到这个 MVC，然后松手

542
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,728
And it says, well what kind of segue do you want?
这里会让你选择你想要的 segue 类型

543
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,896
Show, show detail, modally or
Show, show detail, modally 或者是

544
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:49,133
pop over. Well, we're in the split view controller here so
pop over。因为我们用的是 split 控制器，所以

545
00:27:49,135 --> 00:27:52,002
I want to show detail, right? Split view. Master detail.
我选择 show detail 

546
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:55,406
Show detail. Bam. There it is right there. Okay?
这个是split view，然后 master detail 用 show detail 连接，对吧？

547
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:58,409
Created this little thing here. That's my segue. And
做了这些工作，这就是我的 segue

548
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:01,578
this segue can be inspected. You can see it up here, okay?
这些 segue 是可以被检查的，你可以在这里看到他们

549
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,214
This is the attributes inspector. And it's got
这是属性检查器，会显示 show detail 的类型

550
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:07,184
the kind of show detail, also known as a replace segue.
也常常被叫做 replace segue

551
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:11,055
It animates, it shows that this segue is going to happen
这是 Animates，这个说明这个 segue 可以用动画的形式展现

552
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:13,991
in an animated fashion, so it's going to slide in or
是滑进或者别的方式

553
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,427
whatever. It's not always makes sense to animate but
并不总是可以选择 Animates 的，有时候可以

554
00:28:16,429 --> 00:28:19,963
sometimes it does. Class and module, don't worry about
有时候不行，不用担心这些，比如 Class 和 Module 

555
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,665
that. That's for creating your own custom segues,
这些帮助你设置你自定义的 segue

556
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,233
which we're not going to talk about in this class.
这些内容有一些超前，所以我们这节课不会讨论到

557
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,303
A little bit too advanced. And then, here is the all
最重要的属性是 identifier

558
00:28:26,305 --> 00:28:29,440
important identifier. So here, we have to give any string
我们需要用字符串来唯一确定这个segue

559
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:34,011
we want that identifies this segue. So I could call this,
比如，我可以叫这个segue

560
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:38,682
for example, the angry segue, maybe I'd want a verb
为 angry segue 

561
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:41,885
phrase like show anger or something like that but
我应该用一个动词，比如 show anger 或者

562
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,022
it's fine also maybe to have a nice simple word like anger.
就是一个单一的明确的名词，像 anger

563
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,757
So that's my angry segue right there.
所以，这是我的 angry segue

564
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:50,461
Okay. And so now let's wire up the other ones, Ctrl+Drag this
好，现在我们连一下剩余的控件

565
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:54,331
one down here. This one is also going to be show detail.
在这里按 Ctrl + Drag，这个是 show detail
 
566
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:58,569
They're all going to be show detail. I'll do worried also.
我想这个也应该是 show detail

567
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:03,340
Show detail, oops, not present modally, get rid of that.
oops，不是 present modally，删掉这个
568
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:08,278
Alright. Then here. Show detail.
这个也是 Show detail

569
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,716
Mischievous. Show detail.
给淘气的也连上Show detail segue

570
00:29:12,718 --> 00:29:15,886
Okay, now I need to set the identifier for all of these.
现在，我需要给这些 segue 都设置 identifier 作为唯一标示

571
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:19,223
What's really cool is if I click on one it'll tell me who
特别酷的是，如果我点击一个 segue，他会显示

572
00:29:19,225 --> 00:29:23,227
the sender of this segue is. So there's worried, okay.
这个 segue 的发送者是哪一个，这个是 worried

573
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:27,030
Worried. Here is happy, and
这个是 happy

574
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:30,200
we'll call this my happy segue.
我想把这个叫 happy segue

575
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:34,238
This one, angry already set up. This one, mischievous,
这个，angry 已经设置好了

576
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,876
okay. Mischievous. Hopefully I spelled that right. Okay, so
这个是 Mischievous，希望我正确地拼写了这几个词

577
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,378
now we've got these segues set up so let's run and
现在我设置了这几个 segue，然后运行一下

578
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:48,218
see what happens here. All right, angry, happy,
看看会发生什么

579
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,855
still nothing's happening. What is the problem here?
什么也没发生，问题出在什么地方呢？

580
00:29:51,857 --> 00:29:54,158
Okay, well, it is actually segueing here.
Okay，这确实是 segue 的问题

581
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,527
It's replacing that face with a new MVC, but
程序用了新的 MVC 来替换这张脸

582
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,663
that new face has not been prepared to show the emotion
但是，这个新 face 还没有准备好展示这个表情

583
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,533
we want so it's just showing the default emotion,
所以它仅仅展示在 storyboard 中展现的

584
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:05,569
whatever happened to be in our storyboard, right?
默认表情，对吗？

585
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,471
This face right here just happens to be, or or
这个 face 在这里是这么展示的

586
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,374
it's actually what happens to be the default our model is is
或者会展示默认的 model 表现的表情

587
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:14,611
that. Okay, so we need to, in all these segues, prepare
所以，我们需要给所有 segue 准备

588
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:18,849
the MVC that we are segueing to. We do that in the source
其需要展示的 model，我们在 segue 的源头设置

589
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,018
view controller, that is the emotions view controller.
在这里应该是 emotions 控制器

590
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,287
This is the thing that implements Prepare for Segue.
实现 prepareForSegue 这个方法

591
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:26,924
So I am just going to un comment out the comments here,
我要删掉这些注释

592
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:31,595
okay, for my Prepare for Segue. Make lots of space.
为 prepareForSegue 挪一些空间

593
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,363
Alright, so here we have Prepare for Segue,
在这里写上 prepareForSegue

594
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:36,466
we get the two arguments, the segue which tells us a little
我们需要两个参数，segue 参数告诉我们

595
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:37,401
bit about which segue it is and
这是哪个segue 

596
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,137
what the destination view controller is and then we have
它的目的 controller 是哪一个

597
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,339
the sender. That's going to be those buttons,
还有一个 sender 参数，这应该是这些按钮

598
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,675
like the angry button, the mischievous button.
像是 angry button、mischievous button

599
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:45,509
That's what this is going to be,
这些应该就是这些控件
600
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,977
it's going to be the UI button. Okay?
像是 UIButton

601
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:49,913
This is any object because it is allowed to be any object.
这里必须是一些对象

602
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:50,747
In this case it's a button, but
在这种情况下，就是 button

603
00:30:50,749 --> 00:30:53,083
it's allowed to be any object. All right.
但是，也可以允许是其他对象

604
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,618
So what do we do here in preparing for
我们在这里应该写些什么来为 segue 做准备呢？

605
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,354
segue? The first thing I'm going to do is get a hold
第一，我需要获取到

606
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,089
of the destination view controller, and
segue 目标 controller

607
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:01,692
make sure that it's a face view controller.
确保他是 face view controller

608
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:04,695
Cuz if it's not, I don't really know how to,
如果他不是的话，我确实不知道应该

609
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:04,761
the segue so I'm just going to do nothing in that case. So
怎么为这个 segue 做准备

610
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,497
to prepare for
在这种条件下

611
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,600
I'm going to create a little local variable, okay?
我需要创造一个局部变量

612
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:13,537
I'm going to call it destinationvc, destination
叫做 destinationvc 

613
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:18,375
view controller. And that's just equal to the segue,
表示目的的 controller，这个等于

614
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,979
destin, segue, destinationViewController,
segue 的 destinationViewController

615
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:25,415
okay? Now this is a UIViewController, okay,
现在，这个就是一个 UIViewController

616
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:30,087
of some sort, it's some sub-class of UIViewController.
但是，应该是 UIViewController 的子类

617
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,556
I suppose it could even be UIViewController itself.
这应该就是 UIViewController 本身

618
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,225
There's probably a subclass of it, and so I need to get
这里应该用一个他的子类，所以我需要获得其子类

619
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,595
that subclass, I need to get this variable, in some way,
我需要让这个变量

620
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,832
so that it's a subclass of it. Or I can't work with it.
变为其子类

621
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:44,434
Right? Because, UIViewController, I wouldn't
要不然我不能将一些属于 faceViewController 的消息

622
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:47,871
be able to send any of the face view controller messages
传给他

623
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:51,642
to it, because it's just a generic UIViewController, so I
因为他只是一个通用的 UIViewController

624
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:55,612
need to get myself a faceview controller so I'm gonna say,
所以我需要得到一个 faceViewController

625
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:58,382
if I can let facevc, which is a new variable,
if let facevc 

626
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:01,785
equal the destinationvc As a FaceViewController.
等于之前的变量 destinationvc 作为 FaceViewController

627
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:04,855
Then I'm ready to rock here. Okay, now I have
然后我准备在这里做操作

628
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:07,324
a FaceViewController, okay? So I've just casted.
现在，我通过转型获得了一个 FaceViewController

629
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:10,460
They're similar to how I can't work with any object,
这跟之前我不能做特殊操作的

630
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,429
I really can't work with a generic UIViewController.
通用 UIViewController 类似

631
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,265
I need the subclass. Otherwise how am I going to set its
我获得了他的子类，然后，
632
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:19,269
model, okay? I have to be able to talk to it. All right. So
接下来，我需要设置这个 controller 的 model

633
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,472
now I have this destination view controller.
现在我有了代表目标的 controller

634
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,676
Now I need the identifier. So here I'm gonna say, if I can
现在，我需要标识符

635
00:32:25,678 --> 00:32:30,180
let the identifier equal the segue's identifier. Okay,
我需要让标识符等于 segue 的标识符

636
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:33,183
so here I'm just checking to make sure it's not nil.
这样写是为了检查确保它不为空

637
00:32:33,185 --> 00:32:35,953
Now it should be angry, or mischievous, or happy.
他可以是 angry 、mischievous 或者是 happy

638
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,355
One of those identifiers that I put in the stored word,
可以是我之前设置的任何一个标识符，对吧？

639
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,824
right? And I could do something here like,
我应该写

640
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,793
switch on the identifier.
switch 标识符

641
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:46,964
And if it's angry then I'm going to have my face vc's
如果是 angry，我应该写让我的表情 controller

642
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:50,634
expression be a facial expression that's angry, blah,
表现生气的表情

643
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,668
blah, blah. I could do that but
blah，我可以这么写

644
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,572
that's going to be allot of if then, blah, blah, okay, mess.
但是，会是一些很乱的代码

645
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,308
So instead I'm going to do one of my favorite ways to
所以，相反的是，我会写一些我喜欢的

646
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,878
program, as you're probably getting the,
编程风格的代码，你可能已经想到了

647
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,048
idea about which is use a dictionary. Okay, so
对的，我们要用字典来表示

648
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,752
I have this dictionary I'm gonna type in real fast, okay,
我快速的写一下这些代码

649
00:33:08,754 --> 00:33:12,556
and this dictionary has keys which are the identifiers, and
这些字典以这些标识符为键

650
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:17,761
it has values which are the appropriate facial expression.
对应的值为合适的 facial expression 模型

651
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,732
Okay, got that, so
明白了吗？

652
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:25,402
instead of doing all of this switching on the identifier
与在这里 switch 这些标识符相反的是

653
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:29,206
thing, I'm just going to say if I can let the expression
让 expression 变量等于我想要的

654
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:32,275
that I want equal these emotional faces up here.
facial expression 模型

655
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:38,081
Tha's this dictionary up here. Index by the identifier.
通过标识符来索引字典中的值

656
00:33:38,884 --> 00:33:41,184
Okay? Then I know the expression that I want.
然后，我获得了对应的表情模型

657
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:45,489
And now I can prepare my face VC okay, by setting its
我可以为我要展示的 face VC 做准备

658
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:48,992
expression equal to this expression. Okay, and remember
让他的 expression 模型等于这个 expression

659
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:54,197
FaceVC.expression, that is just FaceViewControllers model
你记得吗? 在 FaceViewControllers 里它的模型是一个

660
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,534
which is a public bar. This View Controller allows
公共变量，它允许

661
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,669
its model to be set externally, publicly,
在外部设置其模型

662
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:04,041
okay, which makes sense given this kind of model.
这让我们可以在对应的地方设置其 model

663
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:06,043
Not all, and doesn't make sense always for
这样仅是在这个 viewcontroller 中
664
00:34:06,045 --> 00:34:08,912
every MBC to allow it's model to be set but often it makes
设置其 model ，并不是所有viewcontroller 都可以设置

665
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:13,216
some sense. Alright, so now I've prepared this Faceview
现在我已经为这个 faceViewController 设置好了

666
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:17,754
controller to do what it needs to do. Everybody got that? OK.
它需要的东西，大家都明白吗？

667
00:34:17,756 --> 00:34:26,396
So now let's run it and see if it's working. Okay.
现在我们运行一下，来看看是否正确显示

668
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,267
So here we go, we have our iPad here, let's try angry.
这是我们的模拟器 iPad，点击 angry

669
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:35,338
Crash a roo. Hmm. Wonder why that crashed? Well let's look,
哦，崩溃了，想一想为什么会崩溃呢？我们来检查下

670
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,941
let's use the debugger. Okay, we haven't used the debugger
我们需要用一下 debugger 模式，我们还没有

671
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:41,044
much in these demos but let's do it here. Seems like,
在这个 demo 中用过这个方法

672
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:43,280
okay, whenever I have a crash, I always look first in
不管什么时候，程序崩溃了，我总是先查看

673
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:45,615
the console, okay, because the console is always going to
控制台输出的信息，因为控制台总会告诉我一些

674
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,918
tell me something about what happened. And here it says
关于崩溃的信息，这里显示

675
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,288
unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an optional value.
在解包一个可选值时，意外地发现了空异常

676
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,857
Okay, well this is probably the number one crasher you're
这种异常你可能经常获得

677
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:56,927
ever going to get, it's one of the few ways actually to crash
在 Swift 代码中，你可能经常

678
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,963
Swift code is to have unwrapping and nil.
在解包时，发现空异常

679
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:03,366
So it is happening on this orange line of code.
所以，在这一行，发生了这个异常

680
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:10,607
I am looking here. Does anyone see an optional here? No?
我看这一行，有人发现这里有可选值了吗？

681
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,110
Nobody sees an optional on this line of code?
没有人在这一行发现可选值吗？

682
00:35:13,112 --> 00:35:15,846
It doesn't look like it, does it? Because you do not see any
这一行看上去没有可选值吗？

683
00:35:15,848 --> 00:35:18,081
exclamation points. I am not unwrapping anything.
可能因为你没有看到感叹号，我没有解包任何值

684
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:21,251
What is going on? Well actually what is face view,
发生了什么呢？其实是这个 faceVIew

685
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:25,589
what's its type? Anyone remember? Our outlet,
它的类型有人记得吗？

686
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:31,094
that's our outlet remember here? Right, it's a optional
这是我们的 outlet，还记得吗？

687
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:36,900
face view, okay? It's implicitly unwrapped okay,
这是一个可选值得 faceView，他隐式解包了

688
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:40,904
but it's still an optional. And I told you in the slides,
但是他确实是一个可选值，ppt 里我说过

689
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:45,041
that your outlets are not set at the time you're preparing.
在你准备 segue 时，这些outlet还没有被设置

690
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:49,179
So this face view right here, okay, is nil, let's look.
所以，这里的 faceView 为空

691
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:52,215
Okay, here's where our variables are down here,
我们在这里可以看到这些变量

692
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,952
clicking on "self", face view, sure enough nil.
点击 self，faceView 确实为nil

693
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,822
So my pointer to my face view has not been set yet by iOS
在 iOS 中，这里的 faceView 还没有被设置

694
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,725
and that's always gonna be the case when you're preparing so
在你准备 segue 时，这种情形经常发生

695
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:05,529
be prepared for that happening okay. So what can we do about
所以，我们应该怎么做呢？
696
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:10,066
it here? Okay well one thing we could say if face view does
我们可以设置如果 faceView 不为空

697
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:14,738
not equal nil then we'll do all this updating UI stuff
我们来更新这些 UI

698
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,874
right? K, by the way why is this happening,
顺便说下，为什么会这样呢？

699
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,644
why are we on this line of code? If we look over here on
这行代码怎么了？

700
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:22,946
the left it'll show us how us we got here.
如果我们看左边的展示给我们的信息

701
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,915
Okay, so we're in this place right here,
然后再看对应的右边的代码

702
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:28,919
okay, and let's see how we got here by clicking here. See,
我们点击一下看看这是什么

703
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:33,156
we set our model which makes sense and it called up DUI, so
看，这里我们设置了我们的 model，然后更新了UI

704
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:36,626
why are we setting our model, okay, let's go up more. Sure
为什么会走这一行呢，我们朝上点

705
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:39,563
enough here we are preparing. Okay, setting our model.
因为在这里我们 prepare segue

706
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:42,566
So this is right, preparing for segway, goes in here set
然后设置了model

707
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:45,302
to our model. Wants to update UI, it's great.
设置了model 之后，更新UI

708
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:48,271
Unfortunately our view is not been connected via outlet.
不幸的是，这里我们的view没有连接 outlet

709
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:50,840
All right, so this is one way we could do it. By the way,
我们可以这样设置，避免他为空

710
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,443
there is another trickier way to do it which is to
顺便说一下，还有另一个复杂的方法处理这个问题

711
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,312
use question mark here.
在这里用问号

712
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:57,981
You know that question mark works for optional chaining,
你们知道在等号的右手边处理

713
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,683
right, on the right hand side of an equals?
用问号来处理可选链

714
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:02,452
It also works on the left hand side. If you put a question
在等号的左边也可以处理

715
00:37:02,454 --> 00:37:05,155
mark there, that's and you can put as many of the question
你可以在等号的左边放置

716
00:37:05,157 --> 00:37:07,457
marks as you want on the left side of an equals. And
你希望放置的任意的问号

717
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:10,760
if any of the things that you put a question mark are nil,
如果你在其后写问号的变量确实为空

718
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,395
it just ignores the whole statement.
他会忽略掉整个状态

719
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,799
Like it didn't even happen. Okay. So, that would be
就像没写这句话一样，这就是另一种方式了

720
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,534
another way. But we would have to put a question mark on
但是我们需要在这里的每一个 faceView

721
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:20,437
every single access of faceview in here. So,
后面都写上问号

722
00:37:20,439 --> 00:37:23,807
we might as well just check to see if it's not nil. Now, is
所以，还不如我在上面检查一下 faceView 是否为空

723
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:28,011
this going to fix our problem? And the answer is, yes it is.
现在让我们看看这确实解决了我们的问题了没

724
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:31,681
Because we do update UI when our model gets set, but
确实解决了，因为在 model 被重新设置后需要更新UI

725
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:37,621
we also do update UI when this outlet gets set, remember?
我们需要在outlet被设置后，更新UI, 记得吗？

726
00:37:37,623 --> 00:37:40,523
So when the outlet later, after the prepare is done,
所以，当outlet被设置后，准备好了

727
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,926
when the outlet comes along and gets set, boom,
outlet被设置了
728
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:46,162
our UI will get updated with the model that we set during
我们的 UI 界面被更新为我们设置的 model

729
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:49,065
prepare, okay? So it's going to work fine, okay?
这里就会正确运行，对吧？

730
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:52,569
But this is part of the reason why when our outlets get set,
这就是为什么我们设置了 outlet 

731
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,838
we update UI and when our model gets set,
更新了UI 然后这时 model 才设置

732
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,208
we update our UI because the order of them happening can be
我们更新 UI，因为这两项发生的顺序

733
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,846
you know can vary. All right. Sound good alright.
有时候是不同的，看起来就应该这样

734
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,347
So we fixed that, we checked this so
现在我们解决了这个问题，我们来检查下

735
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,483
it's not gonna crash anymore, so let's run and
还会不会崩溃

736
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,318
hopefully this is all working like a charm now.
我们运行一下，希望一切正常

737
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,222
All right here we go ready? Angry,
现在看看对不对，Angry，

738
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:16,192
happy, worried, mischievous.
happy, worried, mischievous.

739
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:19,929
Okay. All right? So it's working great. Okay, and
运行起来很好

740
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:26,002
let's try it this way. Slide out. Angry, happy, right?
现在我们这么做，侧滑，Angry, happy

741
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:30,473
Working like a charm. Okay? Okay, all right.
看起来很好看，好的

742
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:35,111
Now, what about iPhone? Okay, this is great on iPad.
现在，在 iPhone 上是什么样子呢？在 iPad 上运行良好

743
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:38,248
Let's try running this on iPhone, and see what we get.
我们试着在 iPhone 上运行，看看是什么样

744
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,525
All right, here's our thing. We got it here. Let's try
好的，我们的模拟器在这里

745
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:53,496
happy. All right, we're happy! Actually, now we're not so
让我们尝试点击 happy，对的 happy
 
746
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:57,100
happy because we're stuck. Okay, there's no way for
事实上，我们没有很开心，因为我们卡住了

747
00:38:57,102 --> 00:39:00,437
me to get back to choosing something else. Okay, I could
我没有办法返回去选择其他东西

748
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:04,274
try rotating. No. I can try sliding out from the left.
我尝试着旋转，不行，我从左边滑动

749
00:39:04,276 --> 00:39:09,579
Nope, no. OK, split view does not split on an iPhone.
也不行，splitViewController 在 iPhone 上是不能分开的

750
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:11,715
Only on the iPhone 6 Plus, which is
只有在 iPhone 6 Plus 上可以运行

751
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:13,550
the only one big enough to really do it,
iPhone 6 Plus 是唯一一个够大的机型来展示 splitViewController

752
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:16,419
okay? So we're stuck here. So this UI that we have in our
所以，我们卡住了，在故事板中这套 UI 不能正常的运行在

753
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,122
storyboard is no good for iPhone, okay? Now we can still
iPhone里，我们现在仅仅可以

754
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:21,491
make our guy blink, okay? But that's all we can do.
设置小人眨眼，但是我们只能做着一件事

755
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:24,060
So unless we're happy just watching him blink all day
除非我们看着他光眨眼就满意了

756
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:27,130
we need to fix this. So how are we gonna make this work on
我们需要解决这个问题，怎么让这个功能在

757
00:39:27,132 --> 00:39:30,800
iPhone? Okay. First we have to ask ourselves what would be
iPhone上也能正确运行呢？首先，我们需要思考

758
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,902
an appropriate UI on iPhone. Okay,
在 iPhone 上的合适 UI

759
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,538
and this is where navigation controller comes in.
这里就需要用到 navigationController 了
760
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,507
Navigation controller would be great here because
NavigationController 用在这里会很合适

761
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:40,777
you start the stack of cards with the angry mischievous
现在有一叠代表生气、淘气、担心的视图

762
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:44,814
worried MVC. And then when you click the face it puts
当你另外点击了一个 face ，它将

763
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,217
a new card on top which is the face. And then if
一个新的视图放在这个 face 之上

764
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,786
you want a different one you just hit back, throw that card
然后，如果你想换一个表情，你只需返回

765
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,756
away, and you are back to the angry mischievous worry choice
将之前的 face 扔掉，你就回到之前选择表情的视图了

766
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,557
again, right? Okay, so it's perfect, okay,
对吗？这样很好

767
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,193
navigation controller would be a perfect UI. So we need to
navigationController 是一个完美的 UI 控件

768
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:00,830
put navigation controller into our story board, okay. So
所以我们需要将 navigationController 放进故事板中

769
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:05,301
let's do that. Let's go back to our story board over here.
我们回到故事板

770
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:06,703
There's a lot of space here.
把编辑空间弄大一点

771
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:10,740
So where I'm gonna put this navigation controller? Well,
我应该把 navigationController 放哪儿呢？

772
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:15,278
you really need one navigation controller around the root.
我们确实应该一个根控制器外放置一个 navigationController

773
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,314
View controller. The base card, cards at the bottom.
这是最底下的 controller，在一叠 controller 下面

774
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:21,251
Okay? So I can put a navigation controller here in
我可以像放置其他控件那样，从这里取出控件，然后放置

775
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:24,154
the same way I put these other things by going down here. You
我可以这么放置 navigationController

776
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:26,723
can see there's a navigation controller right here.
你可以看到，这个就是 navigationController

777
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,758
I could drag it out. I could control, drag,
我可以把他拖出来，按住 control，然后 drag

778
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,429
etc. There's actually a cooler way to do it, which is select
确实还有更酷的方法来做这件事

779
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:36,232
your route MVC which is this guy. That's the card that's
先选中根控制器，就是这个

780
00:40:36,234 --> 00:40:39,068
at the bottom of the stack and go up to editor and
这个就是一叠视图中最下面的那个

781
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,205
just like you did in bed and stack view, do embed and
然后选中 editor，就像把控件放进 stackView 中一样选中 embed in

782
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:44,073
negotiation controller. You can also do it for
然后选择 navigationController，你也可以通过这种方式

783
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:47,210
tab bar by the way, but do a navigation controller.
来添加 Tab Bar Controller，我们先选择 navigationController

784
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:51,381
Now watch what happens here, boom! You put this
看看发生了什么，boom！

785
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:55,318
inside a navigation control automatically wired it up.
这个控制器自动封装进了 navigationController

786
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,855
Now whats kind of interesting about this is, it also made
特别有趣的是，它会自动将

787
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:01,491
that navigation controller be the master of the split view.
navigationController 变为 splitView 中的 master

788
00:41:01,493 --> 00:41:03,927
In other words, it kind of wrapped the navigation
换句话说，它将根控制器包裹进 navigationController

789
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:07,163
controller around the root con, the root view controller
而根控制器还保留了

790
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,866
and kept that pointer to the master. So
之前作为 master 的指针

791
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:14,204
now the master is actually a navigation controller,
所以，master 实际上就是一个 navigationController
792
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:17,974
with this as it's root view controller. Still all these
这个控制器作为根控制器

793
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,643
segways are still here. Okay, these segues are still,
而且还保留着这些 segues

794
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,079
they didn't it didn't undo any of these segues. And
这些 segues 并没有被撤销

795
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:28,485
this is still the detail of the split-view controller.
这个控制器还是原来split-view controller 中的 detail

796
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:29,018
>> How did I put it in there?

797
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,087
I selected this, which is my root-view-controller,
我选中根控制器

798
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:36,159
and I went to editor, embed in, navigation controller.
然后选择 editor -> embed in -> navigationController

799
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,663
Okay? So, now this is an interesting set up right here.
做这些挺有意思的

800
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,099
Let's see if just fixed it, maybe it will just work.
现在，看看刚刚做的有没有起作用

801
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:44,000
Because, you know, I hear,
因为，你知道的

802
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,769
I got this, in a navigational controller, right now, so
我刚刚得到了一个 navigationController
803
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:47,904
it should just work on a iPhone, right?
他会不会只在 iPhone 中生效呢？

804
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:53,743
Let's try it. How many people think this going to work?
有多少人认为会起作用？

805
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:56,246
Raise your hand if you think this is going to work.
如果你觉得会起作用，请举起手

806
00:41:56,248 --> 00:42:01,150
Nobody thinks it's gonna work. It is going to work! Gotcha.
没有人觉得这会起作用吗，事实上，会起作用的！

807
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,186
Okay. So here I am in my navigation controller.
现在我看到的是 navigationController

808
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,489
I'm going to go back. Here is my stuff. Let us try worried.
点击返回，这是选择表情的，点击担心的

809
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:09,492
He looks worried. I am not worried though cuz I know it
确实看起来很担心，我倒不会再担心了

810
00:42:09,494 --> 00:42:14,364
is going to work. Okay so this worked fine, exactly what
因为我知道这起作用了

811
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:18,001
we want on iPhone. Now my question to you is,
iPhone 上运行良好，我的问题来了

812
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:21,604
is this still going to work on iPad? Okay.
在 iPad 上会起作用吗？

813
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:25,308
Let's go look at that. Let's go back to iPad.
我们来看看在 iPad 上

814
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,344
How many people think it's going to work on iPad still.
有多少人觉得在 iPad 上也会同样起作用呢？

815
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:31,848
One. Two. Three. You guys are getting smart. Yes.
一，二，三，你们变聪明啦

816
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,082
It's still going to work on iPad.
是的！在 iPad 上也会起作用

817
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:36,419
Okay. It's pretty cool the way they made this work so you can
只在一个故事板中构建页面，但是能运行在

818
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:39,789
build one storyboard that'll work fine on both platforms.
不同的平台上，确实是一件很酷的事情

819
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:43,626
So here we go, this is iPad, we can turn it around,
现在，这是 iPad，转过来

820
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:46,329
here it is, it is in a navigation controller,
页面在一个 navigationController 中

821
00:42:46,331 --> 00:42:48,264
you see? Which is actually kind of nice, cuz I can put
你们看到了没？这样确实很好

822
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:53,403
a nice title in here for this MBC, okay. But when I click in
因为我可以在这上面写一个标题

823
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:57,307
here, it's not going to slide a deck onto the deck of cards,
当我点击时，这个视图并不会侧滑出视线

824
00:42:57,309 --> 00:43:00,743
it's going to do the show detail, right, angry, happy,
它会正确显示 detail ，生气的、高兴的

825
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:05,381
worried, mischievous. Okay? Everyone got that,
担心的、淘气的，对吗？大家明白

826
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:08,651
how we do that? Now this kind of structure,
我们怎么做了吗?这是一种结构

827
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:12,221
we have split view, navigation controller, and
我们先有 splitViewController, navigationController

828
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:14,357
then the content for your master, and
然后是 master 的内容

829
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:16,826
then the detail right here. Very common to build this,
然后是 detail 的内容，这是通常的做法

830
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:18,928
because if you're building an app that works on both,
因为，如果你在做一个app，这是常规的做法

831
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,298
this is what it's gonna look like basically. All right,
这是非常基本的操作

832
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:22,498
so I'm gonna show you one
现在，我要向你展示

833
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,402
last thing here of interest, which is these titles, okay.
这里最后一个有趣的点，就是标题

834
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:31,874
So we have this little space for a title up here, so
我们这里给标题留了一个小空间

835
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:35,445
I'd like to put a title here, okay. And how do I put a title
我要在这儿放置标题，我怎么在这儿放标题呢？

836
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:37,647
up here? Again, remember that's object oriented, okay.
记住，这一切都是面向对象的

837
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:41,250
That title comes from whatever MVC happens to be showing in
这些标题会在 navigationController 

838
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:43,019
this navigation controller at the time. So
展现MVC 的时候出现

839
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:46,289
I go to the storyboard, to that MVC, which is this one,
我打开故事板，选择这个 MVC

840
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,591
and could just double click on it, okay? So
双击一下，对吗？

841
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:53,296
we'll call this one Emotions, okay. So now if I run,
标题叫做 Emotions ，如果我运行下

842
00:43:57,535 --> 00:43:58,368
I get a nice title up here,
我得到一个很好地标题 Emotions

843
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:03,840
Emotions. What if I wanted a title over here? Okay,
如果这里也想有个标题呢？

844
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:07,844
how would I do it if I wanted a title over here?
如果这个位置也想有标题，我应该怎么做呢？

845
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,512
Well if you look on the iPhone,
你看在 iPhone 中

846
00:44:09,514 --> 00:44:13,650
okay if we go back and oops, run this on iPhone.
返回，要运行在 iPhone中

847
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:19,122
Since both MVCs are in that navigation controller,
因为这些 MVC 都在navigation controller

848
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:24,727
they both have titles Okay, so if I go here, here's emotions,
所以他们都有标题，这里有标题emotions

849
00:44:24,729 --> 00:44:28,865
angry. Look, there's room for a title up here. But
这里也有标题

850
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:34,170
back on the iPad, that's not the case because the detail,
但是，回到 iPad 上，这里就没有标题了

851
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:37,573
when you replace the detail it doesn't actually put it
因为，在 iPad上，当你换到 detail 页面时

852
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:40,543
inside the same navigation controller that the master is
detail 并没有被包裹进 master 在的那个 navigationController

853
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:44,247
in. So the master is in a navigation controller, but
所以，master 在 navigationController 中

854
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:47,417
this is not. So if we wanted a title here,
而 detail 并不在，所以如果我们想要设置标题

855
00:44:47,419 --> 00:44:49,752
we have to put this guy in a navigation controller.
我们就需要把 detail 放进 navigationController里

856
00:44:49,754 --> 00:44:52,488
Even though we're not going to use the navigation controller
如果我们就是想用 navigationController 来展示个标题

857
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:55,858
for anything except for the title on the split view case.
并不做其他事情，在 splitViewController 里

858
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:56,392
We would still have to do it.
我们还得用 navigationController 来做

859
00:44:56,394 --> 00:45:01,264
And in fact, iOS makes it so that just works, okay?
事实上， iOS 就是这么设计的

860
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:04,634
So I'm going to go here. Down to this guy. Okay and
所以，点击这个 controller

861
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:09,706
I'm going to embed him in a navigation controller okay.
把他包裹进一个 navigationController

862
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:12,475
So just have this, I have the face selected,
就这么做，点击一个表情

863
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:17,280
embed puts him in there, okay. Now this
把他放进了一个 navigationController 里

864
00:45:17,282 --> 00:45:20,116
almost is going to work, okay, if we look at what this looks
如果我们运行看看这样设置是什么样的

865
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:23,119
like. Okay? There's a little bit of an issue here because
可能是运行正常，可能有一些问题

866
00:45:23,121 --> 00:45:26,889
these segues are now going to this navigation controller.
因为这些 segues 现在开始指向 navigationController

867
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:32,028
But let's take a look at what it looks like anyway. Okay,
我们还是看一下到底运行的怎么样吧

868
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,363
on iPad look, they're both in navigation controller.
在 iPad 上，确实都在 navigation controller 里

869
00:45:34,365 --> 00:45:37,633
So I've room for a title here now, okay? And if I click,
我挪点空间来看看

870
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:41,838
it doesn't work anymore. Okay, so I broke it by putting this
如果我点击了，这个表情并没有真正展现

871
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:44,941
in a navigation controller. Now why, and by the way,
当我把它放置在 navigation controller 里了，反而破坏了这个表情

872
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:47,944
does it work on iPhone? Yes, still works on iPhone. So
顺便看一下，在 iPhone 中正常吗？看起来很正常

873
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:51,647
it did not break it on iPhone because iOS is smart
它没有破坏在 iPhone 上的显示，因为 iOS系统够聪明

874
00:45:51,649 --> 00:45:54,951
enough to know this is already in a navigation controller, so
它知道这个控制器已经在 navigation controller 里了

875
00:45:54,953 --> 00:45:57,453
I'm just gonna ignore this navigation controller and
所以在展示它时，会忽略它自己的那个 navigation controller了

876
00:45:57,455 --> 00:46:01,691
put this in here. See? So this looks the same, no change,
看到了吗？这看起来没啥不一样的

877
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:02,825
still in a navigation controller.
仍然在 navigation controller 中

878
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:05,361
iOS didn't put a navigation controller inside a navigation
iOS 不会将一个 navigation controller 放在另一个 navigation controller 里

879
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:08,498
controller, in fact iOS never puts a navigation controller
事实上，iOS 永远都不会将一个 navigation controller

880
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,299
inside another one. Okay, if it sees and
放在另一个 navigation controller 里

881
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,235
encounters another one, it just ignores that one,
如果它发现它包裹在另一个 navigation controller 里，它会自动忽略它

882
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:14,170
okay. It's like you're either in one or you're not,
你可以把它放进一个 navigation controller 之中或者不放

883
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:15,972
you can't be in two at the same time. So
但是你不能同时包裹两个 navigation controller

884
00:46:15,974 --> 00:46:20,042
it worked great on the iPhone. So why did it break though?
所以，在 iPhone 中运行良好，但是，为什么崩溃了呢？

885
00:46:20,044 --> 00:46:22,145
Sorry, it worked great visually but it still,
它看起来运行良好，但是

886
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,413
I didn't show it there but it didn't work to click.
在点击时，运行的并不良好

887
00:46:24,415 --> 00:46:26,549
Okay, just like in the iPad it didn't work to click. And
跟在 iPad 里一样，点击后效果不对
888
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:30,019
why didn't it work to click? Well, we have to understand or
为什么点击的效果不对呢，这里我们必须了解或者

889
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,955
prepare a little bit better there, okay?
准备了这点知识

890
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:35,525
And in fact, let's take the time to do this.
事实上，会耗费我们一点时间来说明这个问题

891
00:46:35,527 --> 00:46:37,160
I'm gonna go in the debugger and show you this.
我将在 debugger 模式下说明这个问题

892
00:46:37,162 --> 00:46:40,797
So I'm gonna set a break point right here, okay?
我需要在这里打个断点

893
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:43,199
In prepareForSegue because prepareForSegue is not
在 prepareForSegue 这个方法里打断点

894
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:48,204
properly preparing that thing. So let's see why it's failing.
因为它没有很好地为这个 segue 做准备，我们来看看为什么失败了

895
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:56,712
All right, so here we go. I'm going to hit happy. And
我们准备好了，运行，点击 happy

896
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:59,015
it's going to break, okay, at this prepare.
到断点这里了，在 prepareForSegue 里面

897
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:02,285
So it's trying to prepare that thing to be happy. And
所以，它准备为展示 happy 做一些事

898
00:47:02,287 --> 00:47:06,022
what is, let's look at this destination VC right here.
在这里看看 destinationVC

899
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:11,794
Look what its type is. It's a UN navigation controller.
看看它的类型是什么，这是个 UINavigationController

900
00:47:11,796 --> 00:47:13,896
And that kind of makes sense, right?
这说明了一些问题，是吗？

901
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,531
Because if you look at our storyboard,
因为在 storyboard 中

902
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:19,669
these segues are going down to this navigation controller.
这些 segue 指向这些 navigation controller了

903
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,938
Okay? So that's just a little bit of a twist.
所以这看起来有点纠结

904
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,741
A little bit tricky. And all we have to do is look at this
有点复杂，我们需要判断这个 destinationvc

905
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:28,811
destination VC and if it's a navigation controller,
如果他是一个 navigation controller

906
00:47:28,813 --> 00:47:32,381
then let's get moving inside of it. Okay. And
我们需要获得它里面包裹的东西

907
00:47:32,383 --> 00:47:36,519
work on that. Okay. So I'm just going to say here,
让我们这样做吧，我得在这里说明

908
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:39,755
if I can let Navcon, which is a local variable,
写一个局部变量，navcon 

909
00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:44,393
equal the destination VC as a UI navigation controller. So,
如果将 destinationvc 作为一个 UINavigationController 赋值给 navcon

910
00:47:44,395 --> 00:47:49,165
if the destination happens to be UINavigationController,
如果 destinationvc 确实就是一个 UINavigationController

911
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:54,270
then I'm gonna let I'm just gonna set the destination VC
我将这个 destinationvc 等于这个

912
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:58,307
equal to the navcon.visibleViewController.
navcon 的 visibleViewController

913
00:47:58,309 --> 00:47:59,942
Which is optional, so I'm gonna,
这是一个可选值，我打算

914
00:47:59,944 --> 00:48:01,277
actually I won't even unwrap it.
事实上，我不是要将它解包

915
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,479
I'm gonna say if it's visible view control and
而是，如果它就是一个 visibleViewController

916
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:06,048
if the navigation control doesn't have a visible view
或者这个 navigationController 没有 visibleViewController

917
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,252
control then we'll just leave it to be the destination view
它会直接赋值为自身

918
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:13,823
controller. This'll have to be bar. Okay? So
这样做更保险，是吗？

919
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:16,959
here all I'm doing is, I'm just saying if I'm preparing
我要写的就是这些，如果在准备这个 segue 时

920
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:19,695
to segue to something and it's a navigation controller,
它是一个 navigationController

921
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:22,365
then instead look inside the navigation controller and
我会获取到 navigationController 里面的东西

922
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:26,135
segue to that instead. Okay? Prepare that instead. Okay?
segue 会指向里面的 controller ，为展示这个做准备，是吗？

923
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:29,038
Everyone understand what I'm doing there with these, this
大家都明白我在这里写了什么吗？

924
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:37,647
little Three lines of code? >> [INAUDIBLE]
明白我写的这三行代码吗？

925
00:48:37,649 --> 00:48:38,447
>> Yes, so you're
对，你说

926
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,048
saying, could I go
我能不能

927
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:40,049
back here in the storyboard and
在 storyboard 做我刚刚写下的操作

928
00:48:40,051 --> 00:48:43,452
have all these segue things go down over this way instead?
将这些 segue 直接指向展示的 controller？

929
00:48:43,454 --> 00:48:44,086
You wouldn't actually want that,
事实上，你不会想这么做的

930
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:47,523
because when the segue creates the MVC that it's gonna show,
因为当 segue 创造的这些 MVC 准备去展示时

931
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,692
you want it to create a navigation controller. So
你希望他在一个 navigationController 里

932
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,827
you actually want it to go into this navigation.
所以你希望在一个 navigationController 里看到那个 controller

933
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:54,530
It's just that, when it comes to preparing it, you don't
这样当你准备展示它时

934
00:48:54,532 --> 00:48:56,365
really want to prepare the navigation controller,
你不是想为展示那个 navigationController 做准备

935
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:58,567
you wanna prepare the thing inside. So
而是为 navigationController 里面的东西做准备

936
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:02,104
that's why we're in this code just looking inside
这就是为什么我们在这些代码里

937
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,206
the navigation controller to make the destination
将 destinationvc 赋值为 navigationController 里包裹的东西

938
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:07,576
that we're preparing be the thing inside. Okay?
我们为里面的东西做准备，对吗？

939
00:49:07,578 --> 00:49:10,613
So little trickiness. You'll often have this little code.
有一点点难，你会经常写这种代码

940
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:12,381
I'll actually show you later in the quarter kind of
事实上，一会儿我会用

941
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:16,585
a little more sophisticated way to put this in there.
一个更常用的方法来设置这个

942
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:21,824
You can put it there with one syntactical element,
你可以用一个更语义性的元素

943
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:25,628
it's possible, but this I want to leave explicitly so
但是，我想更明确的设置这个

944
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:29,065
you understand what's going on here. So now when we run it's
你也会明白这里做了什么，现在，我们运行一下

945
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:32,101
going to work because when we segue to something
看看是否工作，因为我们在这里将 segue 指向了

946
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:35,604
that's navigation controls, it can look inside. See, angry,
navigationController 里面的东西

947
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:39,442
happy, worried, mischievous. And the last thing I wanna do
看看， angry、happy、worried、mischievous 都正确的展示了

948
00:49:39,444 --> 00:49:43,346
is set this title right here. Now this title was fixed.
我需要做的最后一件事就是设置 controller 的标题

949
00:49:43,348 --> 00:49:45,247
This is always the emotions MVC.
这需要在展示表情的 MVC 里设置标题

950
00:49:45,249 --> 00:49:49,285
But this MVC, its title kinda depends on what it's showing
但是这个 MVC，它的标题像是需要在展示它的地方来设置

951
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:52,054
here, doesn't it? Alright like if we are showing angry it
是这样吗？就像是，如果我们要展示 angry
952
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:53,556
would be nice if this title would be angry.
它的标题就是 angry，这样应该很不错

953
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:55,958
It would be nice if this title were worried.
展示 worried 时，它的标题就是 worried

954
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,662
Okay? So where can we get the appropriate title here?
所以，我们得在哪里获得这个对应的标题呢？

955
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,098
we'll we can get it form the button that's asking us
我们可以从引发 segue 的按钮那里获得标题

956
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:05,935
to segue. Right? If this angry button asks us to segue then
对吗？如果是这个 angry 按钮让我们来展示表情

957
00:50:05,937 --> 00:50:10,773
let's set this title to be the title of the angry button.
我们就将标题设置为这个 angry 按钮的标题

958
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:15,911
Right? So, looking back here, in our "prepareForSegue".
对吗？回到 prepareForSegue 这里

959
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:20,216
Is that title of the angry button available to us here?
我们可以用 angry 按钮的标题吗？

960
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:25,087
Where? Where can I get it? From "sender", yeah, exactly.
在哪里，在哪里我能获得这个标题呢？ sender！

961
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:26,922
Okay. You guys are getting it. That's really good.
对的，你们已经明白这一点了，很好

962
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:29,859
Sender is the button that's causing the segue to happen.
Sender 就是那个引发 segue 的按钮

963
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:32,661
That's gonna be the angry button. So, it's any object.
这应该就是那个 angry 按钮，这可以是任何对象

964
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:35,197
So I'm gonna have to cast it to be a button. But that's no
所以，我想让它转型为一个 button，这没什么问题

965
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,734
problem. I'm just gonna say if I can let the sending button
我要写如果我让 sending button 作为一个 UIButton

966
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,937
equal the sender as a UI button, okay? And
等于 sender，对吗？

967
00:50:41,939 --> 00:50:45,307
if not, if I'm segueing from code or something here,
如果它不能转为一个UIButton，或者我是用代码

968
00:50:45,309 --> 00:50:45,741
then this is not gonna work.
或者其他方法引发的 segue ，这样就不能正常工作了

969
00:50:45,743 --> 00:50:48,677
But so what. Okay? We just won't get the title we want.
我们就不能给 Face View Controller

970
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,748
On our Face View Controller. But if it is then I can just
获取到我们想要的标题，如果能转为 UIButton

971
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:58,087
set the Face View Controllers navigation item. Does everyone
我可以设置给 Face View Controller 设置它的 navigation item

972
00:50:58,089 --> 00:51:00,656
remember what navigation item is? It's kind of just a bundle
大家都记得 navigation item 吗？他就像一捆东西

973
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:04,293
of things like a little bag of goodies that the navigation
像是 navigation controller 在展示它里面的 MVC时

974
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:08,197
controller looks inside of when that MVC is showing.
navigationController 有的一袋东西

975
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:13,602
To get information like the buttons or the title, okay.
为了得到这个 button 的属性，比如 title

976
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:19,208
Equals the sending button's current title,
等于这个触发 button 的当前标题

977
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:22,912
okay. So this little bag of goodies, navigation item,
我们在文档中看一下

978
00:51:22,914 --> 00:51:25,281
here let's look at it in the documentation, okay.
这一袋 navigationItem 里的东西

979
00:51:25,283 --> 00:51:28,250
I'm going to go here. The I View Controller,
我要打开这个，这是 ViewController

980
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:29,218
it's like a navigation item.
这是那些 navigationItem

981
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,754
You can see it house things like the title to show
你可以在目录里看到 title

982
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:35,891
when this MVC is showing in the navigation controller.
当 MVC 在 navigationController 中展示时

983
00:51:35,893 --> 00:51:39,962
Back bar button item to use instead of the default one.
Back bar button item 就是默认的
984
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:42,765
Left bar button items and right bar button items.
Left bar button item 和 right bar button item

985
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:45,101
You can put you know things on the top, left and right.
你可以将你获得的东西放在上面，左面或者右面

986
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:46,902
That's what's in this little bag of goodies. And
这就是这一袋东西里面的

987
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:50,172
this bag of goodie is only looked in when you are on top
这一袋东西只会在

988
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:54,110
the of a navigation controller stack.
navigationController 堆中最上面展示

989
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:57,279
All right, so let's see if that works.
好的，让我们看看是否有用

990
00:52:00,585 --> 00:52:02,384
All right, here we go. Let's try angry,
运行一下，我们来点击 angry

991
00:52:02,386 --> 00:52:07,022
there it is, angry, happy, worried, mischievous. Okay,
这里的标题有 angry, happy, worried, mischievous

992
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:10,626
and let's make sure that it's working on iPhone.
让我确认在 iPhone 中是否运行良好

993
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:21,837
All right, let's go back here. Angry. Yes.
好的，让我们回到这里，angry

994
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,539
Look he even got the title right. Happy.
看起来我们正确的设置了标题

995
00:52:23,541 --> 00:52:27,743
That's definitely happy. Worried. Okay?
happy，这确确实实是 happy，worried

996
00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:32,381
All right, everyone got that? So this is how we can build
好的，大家都明白了吗？这就是怎样

997
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:36,085
these nice apps that work on both platforms, okay? They
做一个 app 可以适配各个平台，对吗？
 
998
00:52:36,087 --> 00:52:38,254
work in split views. They work in navigation controllers.
这是在 split view 里的，它们都在 navigationController 里面

999
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:41,157
Now if you were building an iPhone only app, you could do
如果你只是做一个 iPhone 的 app

1000
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:44,460
this exact same thing but you wouldn't need the split view.
你可以不用 splitView 就完成同样的事情

1001
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:45,327
You could just take this view and

1002
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:48,264
move your start Your little starting arrow right here.

1003
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:50,633
You just move right up here to this navigation controller,

1004
00:52:50,635 --> 00:52:53,402
and you wouldn't need this navigation controller either,

1005
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:57,139
okay, because you don't have this issue where this whole

1006
00:52:57,141 --> 00:53:00,176
thing is in a separate space like it is on iPad and iPhone.

1007
00:53:00,178 --> 00:53:02,845
They'd all be inside the navigation controller.

1008
00:53:03,347 --> 00:53:07,082
Okay? Now not surprisingly for you're homework I'm going to

1009
00:53:07,084 --> 00:53:09,285
ask you to do pretty much exactly this. Okay?

1010
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:10,186
You're going to have a calculator.

1011
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:12,121
You're going to have a calculator graph,

1012
00:53:12,123 --> 00:53:12,221
have to write the code for. So you're going to have two MVC's

1013
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:14,089
which you're going to

1014
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,358
and you're going to have to put it in the situation like

1015
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,594
this that works on both iPad and iPhone. Okay?

1016
00:53:18,596 --> 00:53:23,899
And now you know how to do it. All right back to the slides.

1017
00:53:29,273 --> 00:53:31,173
Okay the View Controller Lifecycle.

1018
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,641
So I've been mentioning this and we delete

1019
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:35,311
those methods in there for the View Controller Lifecycle. So

1020
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:38,547
now let's talk about what this View Controller Lifecycle is.

1021
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:41,450
So View Controller Lifecycle It's really just a set of

1022
00:53:41,452 --> 00:53:44,620
methods that gets sent to your view controller as your

1023
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:47,489
view controller goes through it's lifetime. Okay,

1024
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:50,626
meaning it's lifetime is it gets created, it does things,

1025
00:53:50,628 --> 00:53:53,429
it dies. Okay, and as it goes through that life,

1026
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:57,299
you get sent these nice messages. Okay? So the start

1027
00:53:57,301 --> 00:54:03,272
of the lifecycle is obviously the creation of your MVC. And

1028
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:08,744
MVCs are almost always created out of storyboards I'd say 99%

1029
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,280
of the time okay? That's how you've seen us do it and

1030
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:13,616
that's how it's done, okay? It can be done in code but

1031
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:18,120
I'm not even gonna show you how to do that in this course,

1032
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:18,921
It's rarely done, okay?

1033
00:54:18,923 --> 00:54:21,490
The great thing about putting in a storyboard is that people

1034
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:24,994
looking at your code can see what you intend visually,

1035
00:54:24,996 --> 00:54:25,995
okay? In terms of your MVC and

1036
00:54:25,997 --> 00:54:27,963
their layout and their segways to each other. So

1037
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:31,467
that's why we try to do stuff in the storyboard. So 99% of

1038
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:35,337
the time these MVCs are being created out of the storyboard.

1039
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:38,574
After they're created they go through the following steps,

1040
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:41,644
one they get prepared okay,

1041
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:44,913
they get segwayed too they get prepared so that first.

1042
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:48,317
Then outlet setting happens that's why we had that crusher

1043
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,086
because outlet setting happens after prepare.

1044
00:54:51,088 --> 00:54:54,056
Then they appear and disappear. Okay,

1045
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:58,627
now this can happen over and over. This thing is gonna

1046
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:01,030
appear on screen, go away, appear on screen, go away. For

1047
00:55:01,032 --> 00:55:05,734
example, when we had the iPad version of our demo here, and

1048
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:08,504
I would pull out the master, and then I would hide it, and

1049
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,105
I'd pull out the master, and then I would hide it.

1050
00:55:10,107 --> 00:55:13,409
Okay, it was appearing and disappearing. Alright?

1051
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:17,179
Then as this is all happening, geometry changes can happen to

1052
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:20,015
this thing, mostly due to rotation from

1053
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:23,886
portrait to landscape, changes the geometry. And then,

1054
00:55:23,888 --> 00:55:26,522
very rarely you can get into a low memory situation

1055
00:55:26,524 --> 00:55:29,358
where your view controller may be asked to participate in

1056
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,660
freeing up some memory, super rare.

1057
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:36,065
Alright So let's talk about all these methods, okay?

1058
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:38,567
After instantiation and preparation and

1059
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:42,071
outlet-setting, you get a very important method sent to you

1060
00:55:42,073 --> 00:55:45,908
called viewDidLoad. Okay Load refers to loading up your

1061
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:49,478
outlets, okay? So viewDidLoad is an awesome place to put

1062
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,980
initialization code in your I view controller.

1063
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:57,319
It's why you almost never have to override View controller's

1064
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,856
init method. Okay it has a very strange init method.

1065
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,624
You don't even wanna think about it's so weird.

1066
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,960
Okay? But luckily you never need to override because you

1067
00:56:04,962 --> 00:56:08,297
got viewDidLoad. Okay? You put all your initialization code

1068
00:56:08,299 --> 00:56:11,767
almost all into viewDidLoad, okay,

1069
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,469
it's kind of like your init for view controllers,

1070
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:17,039
it's awesome. And it's great there because you're prepared,

1071
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,341
and your outlets are set. So it's like, whoa,

1072
00:56:19,343 --> 00:56:21,643
you are ready to really get initialized, okay, and

1073
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:24,146
of course all your instance variables are initialize,

1074
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:27,716
or you wouldn't exist, okay? One really good thing to do

1075
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:32,087
here is to update your UI, so you notice we had update UI in

1076
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:34,790
the outlet setter property observer for

1077
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:37,826
face view, okay? More likely you'd put update UI

1078
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:42,464
in your viewDidLoad, okay. Cuz you know by viewDidLoad,

1079
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:44,166
everything is ready to be updated.

1080
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:46,702
Okay, now you're still gonna want it in your models,

1081
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:49,838
didSet, because someone might change your model after

1082
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,672
you've been loaded, okay?

1083
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:53,642
But no one's going to change your outlets after you've been

1084
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:56,645
loaded, your outlets get set up and now you own them, okay?

1085
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:59,615
So they're, no one's gonna set it to point to something else,

1086
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:03,018
okay? Now one thing to be careful about viewDidLoad,

1087
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:06,989
though, is geometry, okay? The geometry of your view is

1088
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:11,693
still probably the square, okay, of your storyboard. So

1089
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:14,296
it's useless to do any calculations in viewDidLoad,

1090
00:57:14,298 --> 00:57:16,098
that have anything to do with your geometry.

1091
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,566
If you're looking at your bounds and trying to make

1092
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:20,903
a calculation is a waste of time, because it's a square.

1093
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:23,539
It's not, it hasn't been updated to the portrait or

1094
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:26,008
landscape of the device you're running on. Okay,

1095
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,610
so this is the one think you don't do in viewDidLoad.

1096
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,212
The other thing I wouldn't do in viewDidLoad is

1097
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:33,882
anything that's going to kick off something expensive, okay?

1098
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:36,919
Computing expensive or network intensive, whatever.

1099
00:57:36,921 --> 00:57:38,454
There's a better place to do that.

1100
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,656
That's because viewDidLoad, kay,

1101
00:57:40,658 --> 00:57:42,724
your view controller got created. There's,

1102
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:45,294
it's not a 100% guarantee it's gonna appear onscreen.

1103
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:47,796
It might or might not. Depends on what the user touches in

1104
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:51,066
your UI. So you wouldn't wanna kick off something expensive

1105
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:53,702
until you know you're gonna be onscreen. And that brings us

1106
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:57,105
to viewWillAppear, kay? So, viewWillAppear is called right

1107
00:57:57,107 --> 00:58:00,108
before you get put onscreen. So you are sure when this is

1108
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:02,010
called that you're going to be put onscreen.

1109
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:04,780
This is a great place to start something expensive.

1110
00:58:04,782 --> 00:58:08,450
Now you're gonna learn starting next week that iOS

1111
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:12,287
apps, you wanna build them multi-threaded, okay?

1112
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,990
Multi-threaded means, you're gonna have multiple things

1113
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,626
going on at the same time in your app. They'll be sharing

1114
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:20,596
the processor, time sharing the processor basically,

1115
00:58:20,598 --> 00:58:22,030
unless you have multi-core I guess,

1116
00:58:22,032 --> 00:58:25,300
which I guess that's formed is a basically running multiple

1117
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:28,370
things at the same time. Your UIs gonna be running in one

1118
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,772
thread at a very high priority and then other things

1119
00:58:30,774 --> 00:58:33,542
like accessing the network or things that block, things that

1120
00:58:33,544 --> 00:58:35,677
take a long time, we are gonna be running another thread.

1121
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,579
And we are gonna be running simultaneously,

1122
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:40,249
because we never want our UI to be blocked. Okay,

1123
00:58:40,251 --> 00:58:42,951
when user touches on something it should immediately respond.

1124
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:45,354
I don't care what you're doing. Okay, you don't wanna

1125
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:47,589
touch on something and it does nothing, because you're out

1126
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:49,124
trying to fetch something from the network and

1127
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,726
the network is slow. That would be a nightmare,

1128
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:52,961
okay? So viewWillAppear is we would, you

1129
00:58:52,963 --> 00:58:56,064
would fire off another thread to go do something expensive.

1130
00:58:56,066 --> 00:59:00,702
kay, now your view is going to instantly appear on

1131
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:03,705
screen without that data that you tried to get,

1132
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,173
or whatever the expensive thing is.

1133
00:59:05,175 --> 00:59:08,410
So you have to learn to program in iOS, so

1134
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:09,511
that multi-threading works.

1135
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:12,648
And mostly that's a matter of putting UIs on the screen

1136
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:16,652
that might not have all the information yet. Okay,

1137
00:59:16,654 --> 00:59:19,254
they might be fetching some data from the network so they

1138
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:23,258
have a little spinning wheel or something loading dot,

1139
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,928
dot, [LAUGH] dot. Something that tells the user, yeah,

1140
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:28,864
I know you wanna see this data. I'm working on it, but

1141
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,866
it has to come on screen instantly, okay?

1142
00:59:30,868 --> 00:59:33,602
You can't block, wait to get you one and then come on.

1143
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:36,505
It's just, you can't do that, it doesn't work especially

1144
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:37,839
iOS. Like the network can be really slow and

1145
00:59:37,841 --> 00:59:40,809
it might be stall. All right, cell network can be super

1146
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:43,545
slow, so you can't do that. So the viewWillAppear

1147
00:59:43,547 --> 00:59:45,447
is a good place to kick off that kind of stuff.

1148
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:49,151
Now, geometry is more likely to be correct here,

1149
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:51,086
because you are just about to come on screen. But,

1150
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:53,555
I still wouldn't put geometry calculations in here.

1151
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:54,022
There is a better place for

1152
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:57,693
that as well. There is also a viewDidAppear.

1153
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,995
This gets sent right after you have come on screen.

1154
00:59:59,997 --> 01:00:01,430
This is a good place to do things like start

1155
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:04,433
an animation. Okay, cause now you know you're onscreen,

1156
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,134
boom, you can start an animation or something like

1157
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:10,205
that. Okay, similarly there's viewWillDisappear, okay

1158
01:00:10,207 --> 01:00:12,975
usually viewWillDisappear, you're going to undue

1159
01:00:12,977 --> 01:00:15,544
the things you did in view will appear, so here you might

1160
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:19,615
stop your animation. Or stop looking at the gyro, okay,

1161
01:00:19,617 --> 01:00:21,650
because things, things are going to disappear, so

1162
01:00:21,652 --> 01:00:25,621
there's no point in looking at the gyro anymore And there is

1163
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:29,591
also a viewDidDisappear. Okay. This is where you might free

1164
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:33,495
up something you fetched from the network in viewWillAppear.

1165
01:00:33,497 --> 01:00:36,331
See how they kind of a mirror each other, the will did

1166
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,668
appear and then they will and did disappear. Kinda do and

1167
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:43,305
undo things as it goes on and off, and these appear and

1168
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:46,742
disappear could be viewDidLoad is only called once.

1169
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:50,245
Okay one time. This could be called repeatedly as your view

1170
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:53,081
controller comes on and off screen, appears it disappears,

1171
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:56,084
appears it disappears, so this could be called repeatedly,

1172
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,086
okay. So you wouldn't wanna do something in here

1173
01:00:58,088 --> 01:01:00,022
like if you're gonna fire off a fetch on the network

1174
01:01:00,024 --> 01:01:02,424
that's expensive, you wouldn't wanna be doing it over and

1175
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:04,760
over if you already have the information from the last time

1176
01:01:04,762 --> 01:01:08,497
it appeared. Kay, so be a little careful about that. So

1177
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:10,699
if the geometry, if you wanna do something based in

1178
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:12,668
geometry, where do you do that? Well,

1179
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:14,269
there's lifecycle methods specifically for

1180
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:18,006
that, viewWillLayoutSubviews and viewDidLayoutSubviews. So

1181
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:21,643
every time your bounds changes and sometimes when it doesn't

1182
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:24,880
change, be careful, you'll get these two messages.

1183
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:29,051
ViewWillLayoutSubviews and viewDidLayoutSubviews. Yeah.

1184
01:01:29,053 --> 01:01:33,155
>> [INAUDIBLE]

1185
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:33,755
>> Great question, so

1186
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:37,492
the question is, would my bounds change if for example,

1187
01:01:37,494 --> 01:01:39,528
I added a navigation bar at the top or

1188
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:42,030
maybe the tab bar at appeared in the tab bar or

1189
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:45,133
I'm in the split view? And I appeared on the other side,

1190
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:48,937
in other words, can it change due to the environment I'm in?

1191
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:49,838
And the answer is, it can,

1192
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,974
now it doesn't usually change with the navigation case,

1193
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,811
because action that navigation bar is layered on top of

1194
01:01:55,813 --> 01:01:59,381
your view, it's kinda semi see through, if you look. If you

1195
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:02,884
go look at navigation items,in the navigation bars, they're

1196
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,887
actually kind of translucent and the thing is behind it, so

1197
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,823
your bounds actually wouldn't probably change there.

1198
01:02:07,825 --> 01:02:09,758
But they might change if you're put into a tab bar,

1199
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,627
because that space at the bottom might not overlap.

1200
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:15,330
Okay, but the main time your balance changes when you

1201
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:18,667
rotate, but it can happen other times too.

1202
01:02:18,669 --> 01:02:21,269
So between viewWillLayoutSubviews and

1203
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:24,573
viewDidLayoutSubviews all that auto layout is gonna happen,

1204
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,074
the stuff based on the constraints.

1205
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,177
Remember all that blue dash lines and all that stuff?

1206
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:29,711
That's gonna happen between.

1207
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:33,248
So you can do stuff before all the blue lines, the autolayout

1208
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,751
stuff is happening, or you can do it after, okay?

1209
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:37,285
You rarely need to do anything here,

1210
01:02:37,287 --> 01:02:39,087
because usually the constraints are making all

1211
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,390
the decisions about what to do with everything, okay? But

1212
01:02:42,392 --> 01:02:46,228
it is possible sometimes, you know, not in assignment three,

1213
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,830
maybe in assignment six in this class. Maybe you might

1214
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:52,434
wanna do something in viewWill or DidLayoutSubviews. But this

1215
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:55,737
is the only place you wanna do anything that's geometry

1216
01:02:56,206 --> 01:03:00,942
dependent, okay? Yeah, one thing about these methods,

1217
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,144
don't think that these are only gonna

1218
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:04,179
be called when you're bound to actually changes.

1219
01:03:04,181 --> 01:03:07,783
The system is allowed to call these any time it wants, and

1220
01:03:07,785 --> 01:03:10,552
sometimes it might be drawing something to an offscreen

1221
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:12,988
buffer to prepare to do an animation and so

1222
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:14,756
it calls this, okay? But, and

1223
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:17,425
then it actually draws on the screen and calls it again.

1224
01:03:17,427 --> 01:03:20,061
And the bounds have not actually changed, okay? So

1225
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:23,265
don't expect that every single time this calls the bounds

1226
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:25,834
will be different. If you do something really expensive as

1227
01:03:25,836 --> 01:03:28,436
a result of a bounds change, you might wanna keep track of

1228
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:31,406
what the bounds were the last time you did that expensive

1229
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,141
thing. And when this gets called,

1230
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:36,344
make sure the bounds have actually changed, okay?

1231
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:37,979
Again, you're not gonna need any of this for

1232
01:03:37,981 --> 01:03:39,247
assignment three, but it's good to know.

1233
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:41,583
This can be recalled all the time, repeatedly, over and

1234
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:46,021
over. Even if your bounds have not actually changed. Okay, so

1235
01:03:46,023 --> 01:03:48,523
auto rotation. Usually what happens in auto rotation.

1236
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:51,693
When auto rotation is when you turn your phone from landscape

1237
01:03:51,695 --> 01:03:55,230
to portrait, it automatically changes your bounds to be tall

1238
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:58,200
and skinny. And then wide and short, okay?

1239
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:00,435
So autorotation is usually just a bounds change, so

1240
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:03,538
you're just dealing with it in view did layout sub views, or

1241
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,807
more likely, you just have constraints, and

1242
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,043
the constraints just work, okay? So

1243
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10,512
there's really nothing to do, but it is possible to

1244
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:14,449
get involved in autorotation, specifically in the animation.

1245
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:16,918
If you watch an autorotation really, really closely,

1246
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:20,155
you'll see that the views actually move. They move from

1247
01:04:20,157 --> 01:04:23,158
their position in portrait to where they are in landscape

1248
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,427
in an animated fashion. They don't just jump there,

1249
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:29,197
they kind of fly across the screen. And you can fly things

1250
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,200
across the screen, too, if you want using this,

1251
01:04:32,202 --> 01:04:35,837
life cycle method called will, viewWillTransitionToSize. And

1252
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,406
it's basically telling you, this is going to transition.

1253
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:40,175
It has this thing called a transition coordinator.

1254
01:04:40,177 --> 01:04:41,676
You can look up the documentation on it. But

1255
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:45,714
the main thing the transition coordinator has is a closure

1256
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:50,185
that you can provide that will be executed alongside

1257
01:04:50,187 --> 01:04:52,520
the animation that it's doing to animate your,

1258
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:56,391
your, rotation, okay? You won't need this in this class,

1259
01:04:56,393 --> 01:04:58,159
but I just wanna let you know this is here. Okay,

1260
01:04:58,161 --> 01:05:01,863
in low-memory situations, didReceiveMemoryWarning, okay,

1261
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:05,367
this is only gonna happen if your app uses a lot of memory,

1262
01:05:05,369 --> 01:05:08,603
okay? iPhones today have so much memory,

1263
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:08,803
it's ridiculous, okay?

1264
01:05:08,805 --> 01:05:11,740
So this is not really gonna happen, likely. But if you had

1265
01:05:11,742 --> 01:05:15,744
a memory leak where you're leaking videos in memory,

1266
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,479
or images, huge images, or

1267
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:19,915
something like that, it's possible you might get this.

1268
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:23,285
When you get this, you should throw out any pointers to big

1269
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:27,055
things you have in the heap that you can recreate, okay?

1270
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:29,124
So you can re-download them from the web or

1271
01:05:29,126 --> 01:05:30,892
from your file system or something.

1272
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:34,162
You should throw them out when you get this one. Okay,

1273
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,864
going back to the very beginning of the lifecycle,

1274
01:05:35,866 --> 01:05:38,800
there's another interesting method called awakeFromNib.

1275
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:42,103
Okay, awakeFromNib is sent to you really early before

1276
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:45,807
preparation, before outlet setting, before all that, but

1277
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:49,577
only if you're coming out of a storyboard. Okay, so it's this

1278
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:53,181
really, really, really, really early method that gets called.

1279
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:56,151
And it actually gets sent to every object that comes out of

1280
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:58,253
a storyboard, not just view controllers,

1281
01:05:58,255 --> 01:06:00,288
okay? Now I mention it at the end here,

1282
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,491
because I really don't want you using it that much, okay?

1283
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:06,127
You're much better off putting things in viewDidLoad,

1284
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,897
viewWillAppear, those kind of places than awakeFromNib,

1285
01:06:08,899 --> 01:06:11,366
okay? Some people find out about this, and they just put

1286
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:13,969
all of their initialization junk into awakeFromNib, and

1287
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,270
it's not really for that. It's for

1288
01:06:15,272 --> 01:06:16,738
really kind of exceptional circumstances,

1289
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:19,040
where you really, really early you need to do something for

1290
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:22,510
some reason, okay? Set, you're gonna need to set yourself

1291
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:25,513
as a controller of some other object that something's

1292
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:29,451
happening early, whatever. But I just wanna let you know it's

1293
01:06:29,453 --> 01:06:33,054
in there. Okay, so here's the summary of the lifecycle.

1294
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:35,857
You're instantiated, usually from your storyboard.

1295
01:06:35,859 --> 01:06:37,258
awakeFromNib is then called.

1296
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:39,327
Segue prep happens if you're being segued to,

1297
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,130
which you almost always are when MVCs are being created.

1298
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:44,666
It's because you're being segued to usually. Then

1299
01:06:44,668 --> 01:06:48,303
your outlets get set, okay, the things like display and

1300
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:51,873
the calculator get set. Then viewDidLoad gets called, and

1301
01:06:51,875 --> 01:06:54,609
you can do a lot of nice initialization here that's not

1302
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:57,412
geometry related. Then viewWillAppear and, and

1303
01:06:57,414 --> 01:06:59,247
DidAppear and then viewWillDisappear and

1304
01:06:59,249 --> 01:07:02,017
viewDidDisappear will be sent to you as you appear and

1305
01:07:02,019 --> 01:07:04,819
disappear on screen. Meanwhile, at any time,

1306
01:07:04,821 --> 01:07:06,221
whether you are onscreen or not,

1307
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:07,489
whether you've appeared or not,

1308
01:07:07,491 --> 01:07:08,957
you can be set viewWillLayoutSubviews and

1309
01:07:08,959 --> 01:07:11,860
viewDidLayoutSubviews. Okay, and that's where you're going

1310
01:07:11,862 --> 01:07:14,429
to react to geometry changes if nec, if you need to outside

1311
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:17,866
of constraints. Okay, usually constraints will just do it

1312
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,000
for you. And if your memory gets

1313
01:07:19,002 --> 01:07:21,736
low at any time, you could get didReceiveMemoryWarning.

1314
01:07:21,738 --> 01:07:23,371
If you get didReceiveMemoryWarning and

1315
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,205
you don't clean up your memory,

1316
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:27,008
the system will probably kill you, okay? Just probably

1317
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:32,013
your app will appear to crash to the user. Okay, so

1318
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:34,983
I have a short demo here for View Controller Lifecycle,

1319
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:38,219
and I'm just gonna throw some print statements into all of

1320
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,389
those Lifecycle methods. Okay, that's all I'm gonna do. And

1321
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:44,626
then we're gonna run our FaceIt, and we're gonna see,

1322
01:07:44,628 --> 01:07:47,028
as view controllers appear and disappear and

1323
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:50,165
get created, what's happening in the Lifecycle,

1324
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,333
okay? So that's all this demo is,

1325
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:57,305
it's very brief. Okay, the way that I'm going to,

1326
01:07:57,307 --> 01:08:02,243
kind of print in the console is I have this, a little

1327
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:06,648
extension here called, VCL, View Controller Lifecycle,

1328
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:10,952
then I'm just gonna add to FaceIt, copy it in, and

1329
01:08:10,954 --> 01:08:14,255
I will post this, so you can look at it if you want.

1330
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:18,426
But it's basically, it's just extending these classes to

1331
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,628
override all of these, things. And

1332
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:23,898
one thing that's cool is it will show you, the log which

1333
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,001
instance of the Face View Controller, which instance of

1334
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:30,038
the emotion controller, okay? So, that's kind of fun.

1335
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:33,074
All right, so let's go ahead and run this, let's do it on,

1336
01:08:33,076 --> 01:08:37,178
iPhone first. All right, so this thing appeared,

1337
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:41,483
all right, and it's showing the face, okay, this is kind

1338
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:43,618
of like on the iPad, it would be showing the detail here.

1339
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,221
It's showing a face, but we haven't chosen an emotion. And

1340
01:08:46,223 --> 01:08:48,890
let's look over here what happened. Both an Emotions

1341
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:52,894
view controller and a Face view controller have been

1342
01:08:52,896 --> 01:08:56,431
created and instantiated, okay? Now that's because

1343
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:59,734
the Emotion view controller is at the bottom of the stack and

1344
01:08:59,736 --> 01:09:01,302
a Face view controller is on top of it.

1345
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:04,272
So they're both on the stack, that means they both exist.

1346
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:08,409
However, notice that while the Emotions 1 has had viewDidLoad

1347
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:10,612
called, because its outlets have all been set and

1348
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,447
all that stuff, it has never appeared.

1349
01:09:12,449 --> 01:09:14,482
You see Emotions 1 never gets viewWillAppear,

1350
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,652
because it never has appeared. We've never seen the angry,

1351
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,021
mischievous, that has not appeared on screen. So

1352
01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:23,224
it hasn't appeared, whereas the Face 1 has, so

1353
01:09:23,226 --> 01:09:27,428
it's gotten viewWillAppear. It got, it laid out, okay,

1354
01:09:27,430 --> 01:09:29,898
viewWillLayoutSubviews and DidLayoutSubviews.

1355
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,666
And then it got viewDidAppear, and sure enough,

1356
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:35,904
here it is. Now I'm gonna press Back, the Back button,

1357
01:09:35,906 --> 01:09:39,474
and let's watch what happens, okay?

1358
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:42,010
Face 1 got viewWillDisappear because of course,

1359
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:45,813
it was gonna disappear. Emotions 1, that's this one,

1360
01:09:45,815 --> 01:09:49,150
got viewWillAppear cuz it's about to appear.

1361
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:53,288
Then Emotions 1 got laid out a couple of times here.

1362
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:57,892
Let's see some more here, there we go. Okay,

1363
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:01,329
so Emotions 1 got laid out a couple of times here,

1364
01:10:01,331 --> 01:10:04,666
see if you will ask at the same exact size. So this

1365
01:10:04,668 --> 01:10:07,168
is why I'm saying be careful, that can happen multiple

1366
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:10,271
times. Why might that happen? Again, maybe the system was

1367
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:12,540
preparing to animate that thing sliding in, and

1368
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,577
so it was drawing off screen, then it was drawing on screen,

1369
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:17,445
and it was laying out both times,

1370
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:18,813
it's called it both times. You don't know why,

1371
01:10:18,815 --> 01:10:20,615
you don't care why. You just have to be prepared for

1372
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:23,518
the fact that it could call it multiple times. Then Face

1373
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,388
1 got viewDidDisappear because the face disappeared,

1374
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:31,893
it slid off. And Emotions 1 got viewDidAppear, because it

1375
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:35,897
got replaced on top of it. Then notice Emotions 1 got lay

1376
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,399
out again. Okay, even though it was already on screen.

1377
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:40,068
Why, I don't know. Maybe this is the layout for

1378
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:43,238
it actually appearing on screen. It's not clear. Okay,

1379
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,373
everybody got that? Now I'm gonna click on one of these,

1380
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:48,576
I'm gonna click on Happy, and let's watch what happens.

1381
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:52,747
Okay, now most important thing to watch here, okay, is that

1382
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:57,819
Face 1, that first face that we showed up is gone, see?

1383
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:01,055
No more reference to Face 1. It has created a new face,

1384
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:03,925
came out of the story board. Okay, this is what I'm talking

1385
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:06,361
about. When you segue, it creates a new NVC.

1386
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:10,331
That first Face 1 is out of the heap, it is gone, okay?

1387
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:14,902
Every time you segue, you get a new one. But Emotions, okay?

1388
01:11:14,904 --> 01:11:18,606
The root, it's still Emotions 1, okay?

1389
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:21,476
Since it sits on the root, the base of the card stack,

1390
01:11:21,478 --> 01:11:25,013
it never comes off. So, it just sits there forever, okay?

1391
01:11:25,015 --> 01:11:26,514
New cards come on and off, on and off.

1392
01:11:26,516 --> 01:11:27,815
But it's at the root, so it just sits there. So

1393
01:11:27,817 --> 01:11:32,020
it's always gonna be Emotions 1, okay? And then, again you

1394
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:35,623
can see it goes through willDidLoad, viewWillAppear,

1395
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:39,494
got laid out, Face 2 finally did appear, okay? And notice

1396
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:42,597
that Emotions 1 did disappear because it got covered up

1397
01:11:42,599 --> 01:11:44,932
by this one. Okay, again if we go back and

1398
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:47,268
I click a different one like Mischievous,

1399
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:50,938
now we have Face 3, okay? Face 2 is gone forever but

1400
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:54,108
still Emotions 1. Everyone understand that?

1401
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:57,812
Okay, now let's run this on the iPad.

1402
01:12:06,056 --> 01:12:10,658
Okay, so here, okay, we're seeing the detail, okay?

1403
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:14,329
Notice here that even though the master does not appear

1404
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:17,699
on screen, it gets created. Not only does it get created,

1405
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:20,702
it gets laid out. But it never got viewWillAppear and

1406
01:12:20,704 --> 01:12:23,671
viewDidAppear, because the master has never appeared,

1407
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:28,843
okay? Whereas Face 1, it did get appear, and it appeared,

1408
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:29,143
Now watch what happens if I rotate, okay, I'm gonna rotate

1409
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:32,980
right?

1410
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:36,250
to landscape. Okay, now when I rotate to landscape,

1411
01:12:36,252 --> 01:12:39,554
all of a sudden the master, Emotions 1, it got that

1412
01:12:39,556 --> 01:12:41,155
viewWillTransitionToSize thing.

1413
01:12:41,157 --> 01:12:45,293
That's the auto rotation thing I was telling you about, okay?

1414
01:12:45,295 --> 01:12:47,195
And Emotions 1 also got laid out and

1415
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:51,399
told it would appear, and then it did appear, okay? Now Face

1416
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:55,603
1 also got to participate in that rotation. See,

1417
01:12:55,605 --> 01:12:58,306
animatingAlongsideTransition. Okay, and

1418
01:12:58,308 --> 01:13:02,543
then here's Emotion 1 appear. Notice that inside here, okay,

1419
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:06,581
there's no viewWillAppear or viewWillDisappear for Face 1.

1420
01:13:06,583 --> 01:13:08,383
That's cuz it was already on screen,

1421
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:11,085
okay, so even though its bounds changed, okay, and

1422
01:13:11,087 --> 01:13:14,856
it got viewWillLayoutSubviews, it never got viewWillAppear,

1423
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:16,924
it already was on screen. That make sense?

1424
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:20,461
And now interesting. I'm gonna click on one of these, and

1425
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:25,833
what's gonna happen to Face 1? Out of the heap. Okay,

1426
01:13:25,835 --> 01:13:31,506
watch this. Angry, see Face 1 gone, now we're on Face 2.

1427
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:34,108
So even in a split view where it seems like,

1428
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,477
you know with the cards, it's really obvious that yeah,

1429
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:39,247
I'm throwing the card away, I'm making a new card. But

1430
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:40,615
even here in a split view,

1431
01:13:40,617 --> 01:13:41,649
I'm throwing away the detail,

1432
01:13:41,651 --> 01:13:44,786
I'm making a new one. Plopping it right in on top, okay?

1433
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:48,756
So all of these segues create a new MVC, even if they're

1434
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:50,825
a split view navigation controller, whatever.

1435
01:13:50,827 --> 01:13:54,562
The only ones that don't that you've seen is in tab bar. All

1436
01:13:54,564 --> 01:13:57,565
those things in the tab bar. It's too bad I don't really

1437
01:13:57,567 --> 01:13:59,767
have a tab bar, I wanted to show you this VCL thing.

1438
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,770
But those ones get created when you click on the tab for

1439
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:05,673
the first time and they live forever. Okay,

1440
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:07,909
they never go away. And when you click on the tab,

1441
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:10,411
it comes back, it's still exactly the same way.

1442
01:14:10,413 --> 01:14:10,845
It's not a segue,

1443
01:14:10,847 --> 01:14:13,114
in other words the tab bar is not segueing.

1444
01:14:13,116 --> 01:14:15,583
Navigation control and split view are segueing, tab bar,

1445
01:14:15,585 --> 01:14:22,590
notice we never did anything there to do a segue, okay? So,

1446
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:26,360
yeah, notice here also that even though when I clicked on

1447
01:14:26,362 --> 01:14:29,397
here to show this, look what happened to Emotions 1,

1448
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:32,266
it got laid out a couple times even though its size did not

1449
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:35,303
change. Here I'll do it again. We'll go to happy. Okay,

1450
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:38,806
I didn't change, this did not change size in the least.

1451
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:40,942
Okay, and yet it got viewDidLayoutSubviews,

1452
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:44,178
viewDidLayoutSubview. Okay, so you have to be prepared for

1453
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:47,849
that being called all the time, okay? And so here is

1454
01:14:47,851 --> 01:14:51,619
Face 3, it's getting pulled out of the storyboard. It's

1455
01:14:51,621 --> 01:14:54,889
kind of interesting that it gets a viewWillDisappear here.

1456
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:55,056
I'm not sure why it gets that right there. Kind of strange

1457
01:14:55,058 --> 01:14:59,961
I've noticed this,

1458
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:04,098
and then it loads, it gets a WillAppear it lays out,

1459
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:08,536
it gets DidDisappear, and then DidAppear. So I, this is

1460
01:15:08,538 --> 01:15:11,405
strange, I don't really understand why it goes through

1461
01:15:11,407 --> 01:15:15,209
that shenanigan right there, but the good news is that

1462
01:15:15,211 --> 01:15:18,246
once viewDidAppear happens, it has appeared so

1463
01:15:18,248 --> 01:15:21,516
that's good. It's just kind of strange, so be prepared for

1464
01:15:21,518 --> 01:15:23,751
that. Now you'll have this code of mine,

1465
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,553
this little logging thing. So

1466
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:28,356
you can always throw this in your own app, okay, change

1467
01:15:28,358 --> 01:15:31,192
the name to the classes. And then you can see if

1468
01:15:31,194 --> 01:15:33,995
somethings not going the way you expect and the lifecycle

1469
01:15:33,997 --> 01:15:36,130
method is not getting called at the time you want,

1470
01:15:36,132 --> 01:15:41,569
you can see when it's happening exactly. Okay, all

1471
01:15:41,571 --> 01:15:45,606
right, that is it for today. Your assignment is posted.

1472
01:15:45,608 --> 01:15:47,174
I already explained what it's gonna be.

1473
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:51,812
It's due next Wednesday before class. Hopefully you've

1474
01:15:51,814 --> 01:15:55,416
finished up all of the reading for the Swift thing.

1475
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:58,052
All that Swift reading, you're really gonna want to have that

1476
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,488
in your memory bank as the rest of the course happens.

1477
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:01,556
So if you're a little behind there,

1478
01:16:01,558 --> 01:16:05,026
make sure you catch up as soon as possible. All right, I'll

1479
01:16:05,028 --> 01:16:08,529
be here if you have questions. >> For
